This study has two main aims: (i) to assess the applicability of recently published expert guidance from the FRI consensus groups on the diagnosis and management of FRI to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); (ii) to summarise the available evidence on FRI, with consideration for strategies applicable to low resource settings. Data related to the International Consensus Meeting Orthopaedic Trauma Work Group and the International Fracture Related Infection Consensus Group FRI guidelines were collected including panel membership, country of origin, language of publication, open access status and impact factor of the journal of publication. The recommendations and guidelines were then summarised with specific consideration for relevance and applicability to LMICs. Barriers to implementation were explored within a group of LMIC residents and experienced workers. The authorship, evidence base and reach of the FRI consensus guidelines lack representation from low resource settings. The majority of authors (78.5-100%) are based in high-income countries and there are no low-income country collaborators listed in any of the papers. All papers are in English. The FRI consensus guidelines give a clear set of principles for the optimum management of FRI. Many of these - including the approach to diagnosis, multidisciplinary team working and some elements of surgical management - are achievable in low resource settings. Current evidence suggests that it is important that a core set of principles is prioritised but robust evidence for this is lacking. There are major organisational and infrastructure obstacles in LMICs that will make any standardisation of FRI diagnosis or management challenging. The detail of how FRI consensus principles should be applied in low resource settings requires further work. The important work presented in the current FRI consensus guidelines is relevant to low resource settings. However, leadership, collaboration, creativity and innovation will be needed to implement these strategies for communities who need it the most. © 2022. The authors.

These among other innovations have greatly improved healthcare delivery, improved quality of life and also saved lives. The advances in Internet and network technology have produced web technologies which make it possible to offer platform or software as a service via the web, making it possible for end users to access computer resources or specialized computer tools remotely. However, the high cost of image acquisition, the limited availability of medical image analysts, and the limited collaborative efforts between medical experts and scientists are major challenges for medical image analysis in the developing world. The aim of this project was to develop a medical image e-infrastructure called Medical Image Processor and Analysis (MIPAR) to contain a repository of medical images acquired from Africa and a platform for processing medical images. Methods: The backend of MIPAR which is resident on a High-Performance Computing infrastructure was built using FutureGateway, a framework for building science gateway. The image upload and download module was built upon the framework of Open Access Repository with the front end developed using HTML, CSS and BootStrap. JavaScript and JQuery were used for scripting. User's access to the server is controlled with HTTP response and a Client-Server Architecture, while the image processing tools on the server side communicate with PHP using Representational State Architecture (REST) API. Results: MIPAR was tested using brain MRI images. Images were submitted remotely via MIPAR's web interface and kept in the repository. Image processing facility of MIPAR was tested using the brain extraction module, a 3D image of approximately 43MB was successfully brain extracted within 60 s. Conclusion: MIPAR allows users to donate, download and process medical images at no cost. It is our hope that such useful and unique tool will encourage collaboration, improve diagnosis, improve patient management, and promote open science in Africa. © 2018","E-infrastructure; Image analysis; Medical image; Open source; Repository",""

For the development of solutions, hackathons are a method of interdisciplinary collaboration. For hackathon, the definition of pain points that require solutions is crucial. We aimed to determine engineers’ preferences and expectations regarding pain point qualities. Methods: We used a collaborative approach involving individuals with disability, families, and healthcare professionals to determine pain points for use by engineering students during a disability Hackathon. A pain point bank was built using 3 upstream sources: a survey (350 responses, 20 pain points selected), interviews (8 children, 13 pain points), and a multidisciplinary workshop based on design thinking methods (45 people, 32 pain points). A fourth source was 20 adults with disabilities present during the Hackathon. Engineering students rated pain point qualities from each source in a questionnaire that included closed questions relating to predefined criteria: achievability, specificity, relevance and attractiveness and open questions to collect non-predefined quality criteria. Results: Pain points from the workshop were most frequently used (48%); followed by on-site discussions with mentors (43%), the survey (38%), and interviews (31%). On-site discussions received the highest quality ratings followed by the workshop, survey, and interviews. Three quality criteria emerged from the responses to open questions: “representative”, “empathy”, and “real-need”. Conclusions: To be actionable by engineers, pain points must relate to real needs, be achievable, specific, relevant and attractive but also representative and arouse empathy. We devised a checklist of qualities along with a toolbox of methods to achieve each.Implications For Rehabilitation The first step of the development of technical solutions for children and individuals with disabilities is the identification of their needs and their adequate formulation to be submitted to technical solutions providers. Daily life needs of individuals with disability were gathered for an engineering hackathon and proposed as pain points to 400 engineering students. To facilitate the development of solutions by engineers, pain points must relate to real needs, be specific, relevant, achievable and attractive; be representative and arouse empathy; a toolbox of needs collection methods is proposed to achieve each of those qualities. Discussions with individuals with disability and health professionals should be provided. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","daily life; disability; hackathon; Innovation; multidisciplinary; technical solutions",""

This significance arises from a convergence of various factors, including the escalating capabilities and cost-effectiveness of computing and communication technology, coupled with the mounting demands and challenges faced by healthcare systems. The integration of health and technology, when studied collectively with the purpose of addressing tangible real-world issues, holds the potential to generate substantial outcomes that greatly influence the provision of clinical and social care, thereby enhancing the overall well-being of both individuals and populations. In this sense, in this paper we propose a collaborative approach, using Open Innovation, where the most relevant stakeholders—health and care professionals, citizens and companies—work together to develop and validate innovative digital solutions for health and care. We have called this approach of value co-creation the Collaborative Ecosystem, and we focus specifically on the potential development of the Regional Ecosystem for Collaborative Innovation in Digital Health and Care, and the envisioned implications of its implementation in economic and social dimensions. 2023 Carrilho, Videira, Campos, Midão and Costa.","digital health; digital transformation; ecosystem; innovation; open innovation","article; ecosystem; human"

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a Twitter-based campaign centered on using the hashtag #DHPSP to promote the visibility of the DHPSP initiative. Thus, tweets containing #DHPSP were monitored for five weeks for the period 20.10.2020–24.11.2020 and were analyzed with Symplur Signals (social media analytics tool). In the study period, a total of 11,005 tweets containing #DHPSP were posted by 3020 Twitter users, generating 151,984,378 impressions. Analysis of the healthcare stakeholder-identity of the Twitter users who used #DHPSP revealed that the most of participating user accounts belonged to individuals or doctors, with the top three user locations being the United States (501 users), the United Kingdom (155 users), and India (121 users). Analysis of co-occurring hashtags and the full text of the posted tweets further revealed that the major themes of attention in the #DHPSP Twitter-community were related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), medicine and health, digital health technologies, and science communication in general. Overall, these results indicate that the #DHPSP initiative achieved high visibility and engaged a large body of Twitter users interested in the DHPSP focus area. Moreover, the conducted campaign resulted in an increase of DHPSP member enrollments and website visitors, and new scientific collaborations were formed. Thus, Twitter campaigns centered on a dedicated hashtag prove to be a highly efficient tool for visibility-promotion, which could be successfully utilized by healthcare-related open innovation platforms or initiatives. © 2021 The Author(s)","Digital health; Open innovation; Patient safety; Personalized medicine; Science communication; Twitter hashtags","Article; coronavirus disease 2019; human; India; information dissemination; patient safety; personalized medicine; physician; social media; telehealth; United Kingdom; United States"

Identifying such needs in a precise way and specifying the medical device requirements constitute the planning stage, which is fundamental for the success of any engineering products, processes or systems under development. In our continuously changing and extremely diverse societies, a shift of trend can be appreciated in several design areas, which now benefit from the collaborative efforts of co-creators and from bottom-up innovation strategies. Indeed, traditional in-house innovation lacks dynamism, creative power and attention to end users’ needs, as compared with more recent open-innovation environments. In the medical industry, the emergent area of open-source medical devices, developed in collaboration and shared with colleagues, medical professionals, patients and patient associations and citizens, can benefit from the employment of systematic needs identification techniques oriented to bottom-up strategies. In the chapter, we present some options for a methodical identification of needs, as a support to getting started with open-source medical device projects. We illustrate such techniques by means of selected cases of studies, in which the potentials of an intimate collaboration with medical professionals, patients and patients associations are put forward. Besides, the relevance of bridging the gap between academia, industry, healthcare professionals and patients is discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Biomedical engineering; Needs identification; Open-source medical devices; Product planning; Technology specification",""

Disruptive technologies such as the world-wide-web, wireless networking, Open Source software and recent emergence of cyber communities and social networks have imposed an accelerated pace and major quantum leaps in the progress of computer and technology infrastructure applicable to medical imaging applications. Methods: This paper reviews the impact and potential benefits of two major trends in consumer market software development and how they will influence the future of medical imaging informatics. Open Source software is emerging as an attractive and cost effective alternative to traditional commercial software developments and collaborative social networks provide a new model of communication that is better suited to the needs of the medical community. Observations: Evidence shows that successful Open Source software tools have penetrated the medical market and have proven to be more robust and cost effective than their commercial counterparts. Developed by developers that are themselves part of the user community, these tools are usually better adapted to the user's need and are more robust than traditional software programs being developed and tested by a large number of contributing users. This context allows a much faster and more appropriate development and evolution of the software platforms. Similarly, communication technology has opened up to the general public in a way that has changed the social behavior and habits adding a new dimension to the way people communicate and interact with each other. The new paradigms have also slowly penetrated the professional market and ultimately the medical community. Secure social networks allowing groups of people to easily communicate and exchange information is a new model that is particularly suitable for some specific groups of healthcare professional and for physicians. It has also changed the expectations of how patients wish to communicate with their physicians. Conclusion: Emerging disruptive technologies and innovative paradigm such as Open Source software are leading the way to a new generation of information systems that slowly will change the way physicians and healthcare providers as well as patients will interact and communicate in the future. The impact of these new technologies is particularly effective in image communication, PACS and teleradiology. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The role of public entrepreneurs and the collaborative nature of innovation community members evidence a collective action that pursues a socio-political change. Through a case study contextualized during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in Spain, the authors explore how a public entrepreneur triggered a collective action that led to the creation of the innovation community: The Coronavirus makers. This collaborative network groups more than 20,000 researchers, developers, and engineers. They altruistically put their knowledge and resources at the service of the community to provide solutions for one of the healthcare system's main problems at that time - the shortage of medical supplies to cope with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. The collective action of the Coronavirus makers has impacted the health and wellbeing fields, the community and the values that should define social change and allow the construction of a more open, equitable and sustainable society. Potentially, our findings confirm that collective entrepreneurship derives from a function of collective action. © 2023 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

In Vermont, over the last decade, there has been an organic statewide effort to begin to integrate dialogic principles into the public system of mental healthcare. Because of the organic nature of these initiatives, there have not been coordinated systemic changes to support dialogic practices. To learn what visions participants in dialogically informed practice contexts have for the future as well as what structural innovations would support these visions anticipation dialogs were offered at three dialogically informed community mental health centers and one public psychiatric. The anticipation dialog was developed in Finland during the late 1980s to aid stuck professional and social networks in finding ways to move forward looking back from an imagined positive future. Twenty-seven multidisciplinary staff members and one service recipient participated in the dialogs. The authors conducted a multi-step process of thematic discourse analysis of all 4 anticipation dialogs. Findings underscore dilemmas entailed in growing a dialogic practice system, including the toll systemic uncertainty takes on workers in the system and the simultaneous pull to offer some amount of open-endedness to the system change process in the spirit of inclusiveness, mutual trust, democracy, and reducing hierarchy. Other key findings influencing sustainability of dialogic practices in community mental health include integrating dialogic work into roles rather than adding them to existing responsibilities. Our experiences indicate that anticipation dialogs may be a way of conducting systemic research that contributes to the forward momentum of system innovation. Offering a greater length of time for organizational anticipation dialogs would be valuable, as would centering the voices of clients and their networks.

The tools of service design generate visual narratives that communicate experiences of and interactions between medical staff, hospital patients and carers, as well as mapping processes and systems and identifying the nature of relationships between the various stakeholders involved. Often service design tools are used to communicate what was observed and what might be done, but when used as analytical and diagnostic tools, they deliver a powerful means of sharing thinking and decision-making across a wider community beyond the designers themselves. The authors discuss the application of human-centric service design, not only as the means to design innovative service outcomes but to analyse and diagnose the complex processes involved in delivering patient care. The utilisation of this multifaceted design process resulted in richer service prognosis and propositions in concordance with the needs of patients, carers, hospital staff and clinicians than often provided by the more routine qualitative or quantitative analysis of service delivery. Using case studies of projects undertaken at University Hospital Crosshouse to illustrate our findings, this chapter explores the issues encountered during the application of service design and service thinking by clinical and non-clinical professionals, including the lessons learned in developing sustainable innovation practices that reduced reliance on the presence of designers. We highlight the dynamics of this approach, looking through the lens of person-centred service design and open innovation, how staff and service users engaged in exploring new insights and approaches. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","",""

This paper analyses a 12-month co-creation project where a new collaboration model for healthcare innovations was developed by a hospital, research partners, and companies. We demonstrate how organisations experiment with collaborative innovation in the healthcare context, and what was learned from this experimentation.

However, implementing Living Lab concepts requires a very open approach that sometimes contradicts a company's specific business model. Our project uses the concept of Living Labs to create a systematic and participatory approach to providing health care and strengthening community ties in tribal areas. This is, in fact, a regional planning project. Its open innovation platform incorporates three core functions: putting an IT platform for healthcare management in place, providing medical devices for home care through existing eldercare services, and situating communication devices to make daily life more convenient and facilitate tribal community building2-4. Method: We are establishing an experimental field for smart technologies designed to assist indigenous elderly in Nan-ao Township in cooperation with Saint Mary's Hospital Luodong, the Health Bureau of Yilan County, leading tele-care companies, the health care device industry, tribal leaders and community health networks. A university-based community partnership serves as a mediator, reducing health gaps in the region. Empowerment and user-driven innovation are key concepts to develop new service and business models. Research team members, working with tribal device users, design ICT products through a mutually supportive, participatory approach. At the same time, an innovative, foundational platform for promoting community health will be established by all stake holders in this indigenous tribe5. Eight community leaders and around 30 residents have taken part in this project. Results & Discussion: We designed a Living Lab with an e-learning platform to link social networking activity, detailed oral history data archives, and health promotion/rehabilitation activities with health data collections. The data collections were organized through health-related activities, coordinated mainly by the research team and the tribal association leaders. In this system, the community becomes a basic unit for developing self-sustained business and distributing neighborhood health information. Such neighborhoods may turn out to be both mobilization units and Living Labs for gathering data on local culture and eco-region planning.","Communication & governance; Open innovation platform; Participatory approach",""

However, there is too little evidence-based knowledge of current and required enhancements of educators' competences in this field. The aim of this study was to describe social and healthcare educators’ perceptions of their competence in education. The study had a qualitative design, based on interviews with educators and rooted in critical realism. Forty-eight participants were recruited from seven universities of applied sciences and two vocational colleges in Finland, with the assistance of contact persons nominated by the institutions. The inclusion criterion for participation was employment by an educational institution as a part-time or full-time, social and/or healthcare educator. Data were collected in the period February–April 2018. The participants were interviewed in 16 focus groups with two to five participants per group. The acquired data were subjected to inductive content analysis, which yielded 506 open codes, 48 sub-categories, nine categories and one main category. The educators’ competence was defined as a multidimensional construct, including categories of educators’ competences in practicing as an educator, subject, ethics, pedagogy, management and organisation, innovation and development, collaboration, handling cultural and linguistic diversity, and continuous professional development. Educators recognised the need for developing competence in innovation to meet rapid changes in a competitive and increasingly global sociopolitical environment. Enhancement of adaptability to rapid changes was recognised as a necessity. The findings have social value in identifying requirements to improve social and healthcare educators' competence by helping educational leadership to improve educational standards, construct a continuous education framework and create national and/or international curricula for teacher education degree programs to enhance the quality of education. We also suggest that educational leadership needs to establish, maintain and strengthen collaborative strategies to provide effective, adaptable support systems, involving educators and students, in their working practices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","competence; educator; healthcare; higher education; social care; vocational","Adult; Curriculum; Faculty; Female; Finland; Health Personnel; Humans; Leadership; Male; Professional Competence; Qualitative Research; Social Perception; adult; article; clinical article; content analysis; controlled study; employment; ethics; female; Finland; human; human experiment; interview; leadership; male; pedagogics; perception; professional development; qualitative research; social care; student; teacher training; vocation; curriculum; education; health care personnel; leadership; professional competence; psychology; qualitative research; university"

Concurrently, the growth of the internet has spurred innovation in platform development. This convergence has generated technology-enabled opportunities for training sustainability scholars and practitioners grounded in active learning pedagogies. Case studies are one active learning strategy becoming established within the fields of environment and sustainability. However, the traditional case study form and mode of delivery, which excel at a retroactive analysis of strategic decision-making and outcomes, can create challenges for teaching about issues involving emergent technologies and rapidly changing scientific and social dimensions. This article describes one novel platform, called Gala, for teaching and learning about sustainability science through case studies that address these challenges. Gala closely integrates text and multimedia components, is easily updated, and embraces content consumers as content creators and vice versa. We also report here the results of one pilot study that investigated differences between graduate and undergraduate student interactions with different case components. Results indicate that both groups heavily used the case narrative, but varied in their use of multimedia components. Such insights into patterns of case use are informing decisions about improvements to Gala and directions for future case production, teaching, and assessment, in order to create better tools for teaching and learning about sustainability.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Authoring tools; collaborative learning tools; learning platform; open access; sustainability education; user-generated learning content","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; E-learning; Economics; Learning systems; Open systems; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Authoring tool; Collaborative learning tools; Learning contents; Learning platform; License; Medium; OpenAccess; Sustainability education; User-generated; Usergenerated learning content; Open source software"

Suppored by the European Commission under Horizon 2020, mHealth4Afrika was co=designed to be adaptable and extensible, modular and multilingual. mHealth4Afrika integrates Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) functionality with the use of medical sensors and analytical, data visualisation and decision support tools at the point of care. It supports automatic counting of aggregate program indicator data required by Ministries of Health and SMS appointment notifications to encourage attendance at medical appointments. HL7 FHIR integration has also been undertaken to support transfer of vital sign readings from CE approved medical sensors, lab system data exchange, and the ability to import and export individal patient records to support patient mobility. mHealth4Afrika has leveraged a user-centred design and Collaborative Open Innovation based approach, working in partnership with Ministries of Health, District Health Offices, Clinics Managers and healthcare professionals in healthcare facilities in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and South Africa to inform required functionality, workflow and usability requirements. Following three years of co-design, alpha and beta development, the pilot platform was formally validated in real-life environments by 101 healthcare professionals from 13 of the 23 intervention health facilities in Northwest Ethiopia, Western Kenya and Southern Malawi and 28 clinicians from South Africa, between October 2018 and April 2019.

Beyond perceived changes in individual way of life, digital revolution also affects sociotechnical systems, collective structures or communities that delivers primary services for citizens. Healthcare is deeply impacted by such a digital mutation at many levels (patient expectations, caregivers practices and organization). We are probably witnessing the emergence of smart and personalized healthcare with a very large scope. To be included in this dynamics, many healthcare organizations now feature collaborative approaches and open innovation management to improve their performance in a sustainable perspective. But the complexity of systems is often a limit to their progress. This paper discuss the place and role that could be played by new utilities that are naturally based on open innovation approach: the living labs. In connected health where many stakeholders should interact, they are naturally expanding. Using an example, we show the gains in value chain that this new envision of open innovation could provide. In parallel, the paper argues for a development of open innovation engineering in such labs. It leads to the conclusion that a reference framework is helpful in such a perspective. © 2017 IEEE.","connected health; healthcare services; innovation engineering; living lab; open innovation","Health care; Laboratories; Connected healths; Healthcare services; Innovation engineering; Living lab; Open innovation; Engineering research"

On the basis of empirical data collected through 13 focus groups in an Italian hospital, it is meant to show how collaboration can be linked to three main metaphors, each of them matching specific forms of social and professional interactions. The three metaphors of collaboration constitute different attempts to interpret social and organizational changes in proactive terms, encouraging social innovation, or in defensive terms, as action of cultural resistance. The three metaphors are: the apparatus, the family and the team. In different ways, the first two represent forms of resistance to change and they are widely present within the organization. The last, instead, consists of a proactive way to face ongoing social and organizational change.

The use of 3D files in medical education is promoted, but only few methodologies were reported due to the lack of ease to use and accessible protocols for educators. The aim of this work was to present innovative and accessible methodologies to create 3D files in dental education. The first step requires the definition of the educational outcomes and the situations of interest. The second step relies on the use of IOS and CBCT to digitize the content. The last “post-treatment” steps involve free software for analysis of quality, re-meshing and simplifying the file in accordance with the desired educational activity. Several examples of educational activities using 3D files are illustrated in dental education and discussed. Three-dimensional files open up many accessible applications for a dental educator, but further investigations are required to develop collaborative tools and prevent educational inequalities between establishments. © 2021 by the authors.

East Carolina University is home to the Department of Engineering, Brody School of Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Allied Health Sciences, and is affiliated with a large regional medical center. Taking advantage of these resources, the goal of this project was to develop a multidisciplinary, collaborative educational experience, in a clinical environment, to improve student learning. Our objectives were to provide undergraduate engineering students with an understanding and appreciation of the needs and uses of technology in healthcare and to foster innovation in medical technology. The ""Special Topics in Engineering Biomedical Innovation"" course serves as an engineering technical elective, targeted to junior and senior undergraduates. The course was first offered in spring 2016 and includes a didactic component, observation component and team based project. Students receive instruction in observation techniques, clinical environments, professional behavior, entrepreneurship, technology transfer, and intellectual property. Clinic rotations focus on identifying unmet clinical needs with projects aimed at developing and designing a solution. In 2017, a new collaboration with the College of Business Miller School of Entrepreneurship was initiated. At the end of the term, the combined engineering and business teams pitch their ideas to a group of investors and clinic sponsors. Evaluation of the course is based on assessment of student surveys, project reports, presentations and clinic sponsor feedback. A total of 14 students have participated in the course. Student surveys were overwhelmingly positive, identifying course strengths in critical and innovative thinking, development of observation skills, applied engineering, and clinical exposure. Suggested course improvements include more scheduled project work time, access to engineering fabrication lab, and better coordination with the business students. Clinic sponsors rated the students good to excellent for professionalism, timeliness, respect for patients, asking questions, respect for clinic staff and preparedness. In summary, a new course, using a multidisciplinary team approach was developed that provided students with clinical experiences and the opportunities to identify and solve real world problems. New collaborations with the Health Sciences Campus and College of Business were established and will continue to be developed. Benefits of this course are the generation of novel, multidisciplinary capstone project ideas and new collaborative opportunities. Overall this course illustrates the importance of providing undergraduate students open-ended, loosely defined projects, and allowing project teams to assume responsibility for design and innovation. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","",""

However, despite important work, current research is paying relatively little attention to what facets of collaborative innovation are relevant and how they enhance the required innovative performance. To face the grand challenge of public safety, international military organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), need to pursue a collaborative innovation process. In this study, we open up the black box of collaborative innovation by unraveling three critical mechanisms that improve a public organization&#x0027;s innovation performance. Our specific aim was to unfold the ways that Transactive Memory (i.e., knowing who knows what), Knowledge Sharing, and Learning From Failure affect innovation performance. We do this by examining 166 responses from multiple innovation teams at NATO, Ministries of Defense, and Centers of Excellence. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the knowledge coordination aspect of Transactive Memory and learning from others&#x2019; failures enhance innovation performance. Surprisingly, the effect of knowledge sharing on innovation performance is nonexistent and fully mediated by learning from failure. So, we contribute by unraveling how these three critical mechanisms influence innovation performance in a public organization. Future research could validate our findings in different public sector contexts (e.g., healthcare), focus on transactive memory&#x0027;s role in relation to the two sides of knowledge sharing (sending and receiving), and further examine how knowledge sharing impacts innovation performance in a public military context.

The goal of the program was to guide students through a collaborative design process where they experience working productively with people whose cultural backgrounds were different from their own. Groups of 4-5 students worked with a facilitator over 5-6 weeks. The course has an asynchronous and synchronous component to accommodate different time zones and schedules. A series of 5 video lectures guided students' learning along the design path. The students were directed to download a set of notes with blanks and encouraged to actively listen by filling in the notes while watching the lecture. The length of the video lectures ranges from 8 - 32 minutes. A set of 5 individual assignments (in the form of on-line quizzes) were created to support the asynchronous activities. After watching the video lecture, students are directed to complete a quiz. Responses to short-answer questions covered in the lecture and reflective exercises are collected. Students are given 1 week to complete the activity which can be asynchronously. For each of the 5 weeks the student team also worked on group assignments. Models and templates of the group assignments were created to help the student teams respond to the open-ended design process. The culminating activity for the team was to create a video presentation describing their healthcare innovation and the supporting research collected during the program. IRB approval was obtained, and subject informed consent was requested as a prerequisite to participation in this study. A global competency survey regarding “Cross-Cultural Collaboration” was requested from each participating student at the beginning and end of the program. Students were invited to participate in a one-on-one interview, and artifacts associated with the design process (both individual and group assignments) were collected.

ED use for mental health (MH) reasons is increasing and costly for health systems, patients, and their families. Patients with mental disorders (MD) including substance use disorders (SUD) and suicidal behaviors are high ED users. Improving ED services for these patients and their families, and developing alternatives to ED use are thus key issues. This study aimed to: (1) describe the implementation of three innovative interventions provided by a brief intervention team, crisis center team, and family-peer support team in a Quebec psychiatric ED, including the identification of implementation barriers, and (2) evaluate the impacts of these ED innovations on MH service use and response to needs. Method: Using mixed methods with data triangulation, the implementation and impact of the three above-named ED interventions were studied. Quantitative data were collected from 101 participants (81 patients, 20 family members) using a user questionnaire and patient medical records. Qualitative data were gathered from focus groups (n = 3) with key intervention staff members (n = 14). The user questionnaire also included open-ended questions. Descriptive, comparative and content analyses were produced. Results: Key implementation issues were identified in relation to system, organizational and patient profiles, similar to results identified in most studies in the ED implementation literature aimed at improving responsiveness to patients with MD. Results were encouraging, as the innovations had a significant impact for improved patient MH service use and adequacy of care. Services also seemed adapted to patient profiles. Family members were grateful for the help received in the ED. Conclusions: Before implementing innovations, managers need to recognize the basic issues common to all new healthcare interventions: the need for staff training and strong involvement, particularly among physicians, development of collaborative tools especially in cases of potential cultural clash between staff and organizations, and continuous quality assessment. Future research needs to confirm the pertinence of these interventions, especially use of family-peer support teams in ED, as a highly innovative intervention. Broader ED strategies could also be deployed to improve MH services and decrease ED use for MH reasons.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Brief intervention team; Crisis center team; Emergency department use; Family-peer support team; Implementation; Innovation; Mental disorders; Patient outcomes","Adult; Crisis Intervention; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Quebec; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; crisis intervention; female; hospital emergency service; human; information processing; male; mental disease; mental health service; middle aged; Quebec; questionnaire; young adult"

Design A classic eDelphi completed in three rounds, conducted as the launch study to a multiphase national project (evaluating follow-up and complexity in cancer clinical trials). Setting Multicentre online survey involving professionals at National Health Service secondary care hospital sites in Scotland and England varied in scale, geographical location and patient populations. Participants Principal investigators at 13 hospitals across nine clinical research networks recruited 33 participants using pre-defined eligibility criteria to form a multidisciplinary panel. Main outcome measures Statements achieving a consensus level of 70% on a 7-point Likert-type scale and ranked trial rating indicators (TRIs) developed by research professionals. Results The panel developed 75 consensus statements illustrating factors contributing to complexity, follow-up intensity and operational performance in trial delivery, and specified 14 ranked TRIs. Seven open questions in the first qualitative round generated 531 individual statements. Iterative survey rounds returned rates of 82%, 82% and 93%. Conclusions Clinical trials operate within a dynamic, complex healthcare and innovation system where rapid scientific advances present opportunities and challenges for delivery organisations and professionals. Panellists highlighted cultural and organisational factors limiting the profession's potential to support growing trial complexity and patient follow-up. Enhanced communication, interoperability, funding and capacity have emerged as key priorities. Future operational models should test dialectic Singerian-based approaches respecting open dialogue and shared values. Research capacity building should prioritise innovative, collaborative approaches embedding validated review and evaluation models to understand changing operational needs and challenges.

First, we set the following three parameters to observe cases: (i) the FDA regulatory reforms, (ii) early application of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), to both research and clinical settings, and (iii) accumulation of open data. Then, we performed a comparative analysis of MSK-IMPACT with FoundationOne CDx and Oncomine Dx Target Test, both of which were FDA-approved tumor profiling tests launched in 2017. As a result, we found that MSK-IMPACT secures neutrality as a non-profit organization, achieves the active incorporation of basic research results, and performs superiorly in clinical operations, such as patient enrollment. On the contrary, we confirmed that FoundationOne CDx was the most prominent case in terms of the number of new drugs and expanded indications approved in which the FDA’s expedited approval programs were considerably utilized. Consequently, to uncover the full potential of MSK-IMPACT, it is suggested that more intersectoral collaborative activities between various healthcare stakeholders, in particular, pharmaceutical companies, for driving clinical development must be carried out based on an organizational framework that facilitates collaboration. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","New drug development; Next-generation sequencing (NGS); Open data; Regulatory reform; Tumor profiling test","afatinib; capecitabine; capmatinib; dabrafenib; entrectinib; larotrectinib; neratinib; olaparib; pembrolizumab; pemigatinib; pralsetinib; trametinib; vemurafenib; Article; bile duct carcinoma; bioinformatics; breast cancer; comparative study; controlled study; drug approval; drug development; drug indication; drug industry; Erdheim Chester disease; Food and Drug Administration; health care; high throughput sequencing; human; human tissue; non small cell lung cancer; oncology; ovary cancer; solid malignant neoplasm; squamous cell carcinoma; technology"

Pharmacists can support carers and healthcare professionals to manage medicines in line with stopping over-medication of people with a learning disability, autism or both principles. Healthcare staff and carers were interviewed to see how they felt about working with a pharmacist and how this helped them to look after people with learning disabilities. Healthcare professionals and carers felt that the pharmacist was very helpful and listened to them. Abstract: Background The issues surrounding the prescribing and monitoring of medications for people with learning disabilities and behaviours deemed to be challenging, and are complex in their management for patients, healthcare professionals and carers. The aim of the study was to explore the impact of the pharmacist independent prescriber on a medication clinic for people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours from the perspectives of healthcare professionals and carers in a UK mental health Trust setting. Materials and Methods Qualitative methods were used to provide an understanding of the participants' interactions with the pharmacist in the context of the medication clinic. Individual, semi-structured interviews were carried out with staff and carers, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was carried out to identify themes which illuminated the participants' experiences. Recruitment took place December 2017–August 2018. Results Nine participants took part (six staff and three full-time carers). Eight themes were constructed from the data: five from staff and three from the carer cohort: being open to innovation and change in collaborative practice, challenging traditional norms in collaborative approaches to person-centred care, proactive empowerment via maximisation of expertise and resources, supporting and empowering informed decision-making, encouraging collaborative debate around medication, establishing authentic and interactive dialogue, gaining trust of the pharmacist independent prescriber's role in the management of patients and feeling empowered to challenge ambiguity and inconsistency in prescribing practice. Conclusion The pharmacist independent prescriber is a valued asset, with high levels of interaction between all staff, carers and an integral aspect of services provided. © 2020 The Authors.

Realizing this impact, though, rests on first addressing the fundamental challenge of designing automation to be aware of, and responsive to, the human with whom it is interacting. While a significant body of work exists in intent inference based on human motion, a human's physical actions alone are not necessarily a predictor of their decision-making. Indeed, cognitive factors, such as trust and workload, play a substantial role in their decision making as it relates to interactions with autonomous systems. While these factors have long been studied by cognitive psychologists and human factors experts, consideration of them in the context of closed-loop interactions between humans and autonomous systems remains a nascent area of research. In this chapter, parameterized and data-driven modeling frameworks are presented for quantifying input–output relationships as they relate to dynamic cognitive states, particularly human trust. Innovations in human subject experiment design needed to not only generate essential training data but also validate models and subsequent control policies are also discussed. The third topic of discussion is the design of algorithms to govern closed-loop interactions based on calibration of human cognitive states. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of open challenges and opportunities for further investigation on these topics. © 2023 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Research over a decade ago showed that the governance relied on clan-based mechanisms, while lacking formal rules and incentives for collaborations. Awareness and reflection were seen as first steps towards progression. We aim to identify critical governance features of contemporary mandated collaboratives by discussing cases introduced by the healthcare professionals and managers themselves. Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 24) with two regional mandated collaboratives took place from November 2019 to November 2020 in the Netherlands to learn more about critical governance features. The interviews were thematically analysed by the project team (authors) to synthesise the results and were subsequently validated during a focus group. Results: Critical governance features of interorganisational activities in mandated collaboratives include the gradual formulation of shared vision and clear client-centred goals, building trust and acquaintanceship for the advancement of an open collaborative culture, establishing a non-extreme formalised governance structure through leadership, mutual trust and innovation support and facilitating information exchange and formalisation tools for optimal elderly care. Conclusion: Trust and leadership form the backbone of interorganisational functioning. Interorganisational functioning should be seen in light of their national embedment and resources that are (being made) available, which makes them susceptible to constant change as they struggle with balancing between critical features in a fluid and intermingled governance context. The identified critical features of (contemporary) mandated collaboratives may aid in assessing and improving interprofessional functioning within integrated elderly care. International debate on governance expectations of mandated collaboratives may further contribute to sharpening the roles of both managers and healthcare professionals. © 2023, The Author(s).","Elderly care; Governance; Integrated care; Interorganisational collaboration; Interprofessional functioning; Mandated collaboratives; Qualitative research","Cooperative Behavior; Focus Groups; Health Personnel; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Qualitative Research; aged; article; clinical article; elderly care; expectation; female; human; leadership; male; manager; Netherlands; qualitative research; semi structured interview; trust; vision; cooperation; health care personnel; information processing; public relations; qualitative research"

Moreover, the enormous technological potential developed over the last years is increasingly influencing life sciences and driving changes toward personalized medicine and value-based healthcare. However, the current slow progression of adoption, limiting the generation of healthcare efficiencies through technological innovation, can be realistically overcome by fostering convergence between a systems medicine approach and the principles governing Integrated Care. Implicit with this strategy is the multidisciplinary active collaboration of all stakeholders involved in the change, namely: citizens, professionals with different profiles, academia, policy makers, industry and payers.

Demands and constraints in the supply chain design operations are worthy of attention. The present paper is intended to study the supplier selection problem in a network of suppliers and buyers in the context of a multi-product supply chain. In the beginning, quality measures for supplier selection are collected and categorized into seven areas. Every quality area has been evaluated using the proposed fuzzy variables. In order to rank each product of each supplier in the view of every buyer, fuzzy AHP algorithm was applied. A multi-objective integer programing model was designed to make the whole network beneficial from cost as well as quality metrics. A Genetic Algorithm (3 dimensional) was presented in this study to gain acceptable solution in an advance way.

In contrast, computer technology utilized within the healthcare industry often evolves at a glacial pace, with reduced opportunities for justified innovation. Although the use of timely technology refreshes within an enterprise's overall technology stack can be costly, thoughtful adoption of select technologies with a demonstrated return on investment can be very effective in increasing productivity and at the same time, reducing the burden of maintenance often associated with older and legacy systems. In this brief technical communication, we introduce the concept of microservices as applied to the ecosystem of data analysis pipelines. Microservice architecture is a framework for dividing complex systems into easily managed parts. Each individual service is limited in functional scope, thereby conferring a higher measure of functional isolation and reliability to the collective solution. Moreover, maintenance challenges are greatly simplified by virtue of the reduced architectural complexity of each constitutive module. This fact notwithstanding, rendered overall solutions utilizing a microservices-based approach provide equal or greater levels of functionality as compared to conventional programming approaches. Bioinformatics, with its ever-increasing demand for performance and new testing algorithms, is the perfect use-case for such a solution. Moreover, if promulgated within the greater development community as an open-source solution, such an approach holds potential to be transformative to current bioinformatics software development. Context: Bioinformatics relies on nimble IT framework which can adapt to changing requirements. Aims: To present a well-established software design and deployment strategy as a solution for current challenges within bioinformatics Conclusions: Use of the microservices framework is an effective methodology for the fabrication and implementation of reliable and innovative software, made possible in a highly collaborative setting. © 2016 Journal of Pathology Informatics | Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.","Bioinformatics; crowd sourcing; defect analysis; failure mode analysis; information technology; microservices; pathology; reliability engineering; software engineering",""

Creativity promotion techniques have been searched for and generated along the centuries, in parallel with a progressive process of rapprochement to comprehend the basic mechanisms of innovative thinking. The final aim is finding unconventional, effective and efficient solutions to complex problems. In the last decades, the innovation cycle in engineering fields, as connected to the development of processes, products and systems, has been importantly reformulated, in a way reinvented, through the growing internationalization and multidisciplinary ambience in project teams. Furthermore, emergent open-source approaches to technology development, which benefit in many cases from co-creation among global communities interacting online, constitute a relevant driver of change challenging the status quo. All the aforementioned importantly affects the ideation, design, manufacture and use of open-source medical technologies. In consequence, as a support to innovators in the medical field, this chapter describes the innovation cycle, presents some widely accepted creativity promotion techniques and illustrates them by explaining different case studies linked to medical device projects. The potentials of open-source and collaborative strategies for the development of innovative healthcare technologies are also examined and exemplified with selected developments from the UBORA e-infrastructure and community. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Conceptual design; Creativity promotion; Innovation management; Open-source medical devices",""

Open innovation does not replace a traditional closed R&D model; but in the current crisis situation, it can support an ecosystem stakeholders’ effort by leveraging several collaborations. Based on the Tunisian experience, this study illustrates how a crisis can spontaneously create these collaborations between the maker’s community, the users (public healthcare professionals) and key stakeholders (universities, civil society and the private sector among others). To investigate this research question, we adopted a qualitative approach based on a single embedded case study and collected data through participant observation technique. The case study describes a process of crisis-driven innovation based on 3D printing technologies in order to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare professionals. It highlights two distinct phases describing the evolution from a local collaborative model to the creation of a national ecosystem able to design, manufacture and address the growing need of the public healthcare system. Our findings show with empirical evidence the crucial roles played by the makers’ community, FabLabs and engineers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This study draws lessons on how a large health crisis can trigger national crisis-driven innovation (CDI) initiatives, which helped structure the makers’ network and promote collaboration towards a common national goal. A collaborative framework for CDI initiated by the Tunisian makers’ community is proposed in this study and could be adopted in similar crisis contexts, in Global South and North settings. © 2021 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","",""

Methods and analysis We will conduct the first systematic review of living labs across healthcare contexts. We will comprehensively search the following online databases from inception to 31 December 2020: Scopus, the Cochrane Library (Wiley), Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Web of Science, PsycINFO (OVID) and EBSCOhost databases including Academic Search Complete, Business Source Premier, Canadian Reference Centre, CINAHL, MasterFILE Premier, SPORTDiscus, Library & Information Science Source, Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts, AgeLine, EconLit, Art Full Text, Women's Studies International and Social Work Abstracts. We will search for grey literature using Google advanced techniques and books/book chapters through scholarly and bibliographical databases. We will use a dual-reviewer, two-step selection process with pre-established inclusion criteria and limit to English language publications. Empirical studies of any design examining living lab development, implementation or evaluation in health or healthcare will be included. We will use the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for methodological quality appraisal and Covidence software for review management, and we will extract data on pre-established variables such as lab context and technological platforms. We will create evidence tables and analyse across variables such as focal aim and achievement of living lab principles, such as the use of cocreation and multimethod approaches. We will tabulate data for descriptive reporting and narrative synthesis to identify current applications, approaches and promising areas for living lab development across health contexts. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was not required for this review. This review will inform research into living labs in health environments, including guidance for a living lab in paediatric rehabilitation. Academic publications shared through collaborative networks and social media channels will provide substantive knowledge to the growing tech-health development sector and to researchers, practitioners and organisations seeking enhanced patient/stakeholder engagement and innovations in knowledge translation and evidence-based practice.

EUPATI.be brings together various stakeholders from different areas related to healthcare including patients, academia and industry. In doing so, we create an innovative collaborative approach where actors from different backgrounds work toward improving patient involvement in medical research, and putting the patient at the center of the Belgian healthcare system. Previously, we performed in-depth interviews with a small group of stakeholders on patient involvement. Here, we elaborate on our previous findings by using a nation-wide survey to inquire into Belgian stakeholders' perception on patient involvement. To this end, an electronic survey was available in French, Dutch and English, and accessible for 11 months. Twelve questions were asked, including 11 multiple choice questions and 1 open question. The latter was thematically analyzed according to the framework method. A total of 117 responses were registered and descriptive statistics were performed. The majority of respondents could be categorized into patient, academia and industry, whereas policy makers, payers, and healthcare professionals were underrepresented. We identified several barriers that hamper patient involvement, which were sometimes more reported by specific stakeholder groups. Next, we found that various stakeholders still consider patient involvement as a passive role, i.e., medical subject in a clinical trial. Respondents also reported that the role of the various stakeholders needed more clarification; this was also confirmed by the level of trust amongst the various stakeholders. Existing and the wish for more collaboration with the various stakeholders was reported by almost all respondents. Based on this survey, we can define the potential of involving patients in the medical research and development in the Belgian landscape. Our results will help to understand and tackle the various barriers that currently hamper patient involvement, whilst highlighting the need for a collaborative landscape from the multi-stakeholder perspective. © Copyright © 2020 Grine, Janssens, van Overbeeke, Derijcke, Silva, Delys, Dusart, Aertsen, Mertens de Wilmars, Robaczewska and Stevens.","medical innovation; multi-stakeholder; patient engagement; patient involvement; survey","adult; article; controlled study; human; interview; medical research; multiple choice test; patient participation; perception; trust"

Smaller outer-diameter working-channel endoscopes have permitted safe usage in the cervical spine for full endoscopic decompressions. Endoscopic fusions have now been widely reported, leveraging compatible instrumentation for disc preparation and expandable interbody grafts. This ultra–minimally invasive technique has also enabled the performance of fusion procedures in awake patients under monitored anesthesia care, affording speedier recovery and treatment options for those unable to undergo general anesthesia. Revision surgery after open or minimally invasive posterior discectomy or instrumentation can now be performed with endoscopic techniques, which often leverage the transforaminal approach to avoid scar tissue and adhesions. These procedures, among other endoscopic surgeries, are now being increasingly performed in ambulatory surgery centers, as safe outcomes, economic benefits to the healthcare system, and patients' desire to recover at home are becoming more apparent. Finally, the standardization of endoscopic terminology, which has long been a confounder to proper communication and education in this field, has recently been addressed by leading experts in a consensus document, which will serve as the foundation for future collaborative advancements. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Anterior lumbar interbody fusion; Lateral lumbar interbody fusion; Minimally invasive; Spinal endoscopy; TLIF; Transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy; ULBD","Cervical Vertebrae; Diskectomy; Endoscopes; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; ambulatory surgery; Article; cervical spine; decompression surgery; endoscopic surgery; human; minimally invasive procedure; nomenclature; posterior lumbar interbody fusion; spine surgery; standardization; cervical vertebra; discectomy; endoscope; gastrointestinal endoscopy; lumbar vertebra; procedures; surgery"

It requires different skills and thought processes across national borders. Thinking in an innovative manner may provide healthcare workers with some of the necessary tools to facilitate international change by increasing students’ mental flexibility and ability to apply solutions in multiple contexts. We created the International Innovation Program for health profession education students to learn about and implement the innovation process. The programme provides students the opportunity to learn in interprofessional, international teams and apply didactic knowledge to community problems using the innovation process. The purpose of this article is to describe student perceptions across 4 years of programme implementation. Through analysis of closed-ended survey data, we found that students who participated in the programme reported improvements in collaboration and teamwork, project management, interprofessional teamwork, professional growth and development, thinking in an innovative manner, research and development skills, information seeking, and willingness to work on international projects. Analysis of the open-ended questions revealed five themes: language, teamwork and collaboration, cultural awareness, innovation process, and personal growth and self-improvement. The long-term, follow-up data indicate that these attributes can be transferred into a clinical context which have implications for improved collaboration and patient care. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Collaborative outcomes; education; interprofessional collaboration; interprofessional learning; surveys","Adult; Africa, Northern; Cooperative Behavior; Curriculum; Europe; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Occupations; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Patient Care Team; Problem-Based Learning; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; awareness; education; Europe; follow up; human; human experiment; information seeking; language; learning; North America; occupation; patient care; perception; skill; student; teamwork; thinking; adult; Africa; attitude to health; cooperation; curriculum; Europe; female; longitudinal study; male; medical profession; problem based learning; public relations; questionnaire; young adult"

However, in many cases, medical technology is developed in secrecy, and patients’ or medical professionals’ needs are considered as a minor part of the decision-making process, instead of being driven by relevant emergent social needs. In contrast with the biomedical industry, many product fields are now involving stakeholders and future users, since the beginning of the product development process, embracing the new paradigm of “open innovation” and showing interesting results in terms of improved performance, safety, and costs, among others. However, healthcare industry is still reluctant to taking advantage of the enormous potentials of open-source and collaborative approach toward a social development of medical devices. In order to highlight the potentials of open-source and collaborative engineering and design approaches for the future of biomedical industry and to help with its transformation, this chapter is focused on: (1) adequately defining the concept of open-source medical device (OSMD) and its boundaries, (2) presenting pioneering cases of success in the OSMD field and discussing their relevance, and (3) introducing the UBORA e-infrastructure and community, as key initiative in the field.

VA has made a strategic decision to incorporate an open source software strategy into the modernization plan for its healthcare information system, VistA, as a part of the Open Government Policy. VA established the Open Source Electronic Health Record Alliance (OSEHRA) in 2011 as an independent nonprofit organization outside of government to be a hub for collaboration and rapid innovation. OSEHRA was chartered to build a community that included government as well as members of a global private sector that has developed commercial systems and services incorporating VistA software that has been in the public domain. VA's strategy is a bold attempt to harness the power of community collaboration in support of critical government infrastructure. This paper describes how OSEHRA facilitates transparent interactions between the global private sector and a major federal government agency, while dealing with traditional rules and regulations that often impede open collaboration. It describes several key milestones in the process, including the establishment of an independent certification process for open source code, the community-based collaborative development of a groundbreaking visualization tool to promote community understanding of the system, adoption by VA of major open source code improved and certified by the community, and the first community-wide consensus on code convergence. VA's participation in the code convergence has created the opportunity for a jointly-maintained code base that will benefit not only the U.S. Government, but also healthcare providers around the world. While much work remains in realizing the benefits of this strategy, determined efforts within and outside Government have created a significant opportunity and an informative case study in e-Government. © The Authors, 2016.","E-government; Electronic health record (EHR); Health IT; Open source; OSEHRA; VistA","Codes (symbols); Government data processing; Health; Health care; Open systems; Records management; Software engineering; E-governments; Electronic health record; Health it; Open sources; OSEHRA; VistA; Open source software"

This is especially so for workplace learning technology where learning and the use of technology needs to be embedded in working practices. We report on Learning Layers, a TEL project on workplace learning that ran between 2012 and 2016. We have identified three cases where impact on practice is still visible today, as learning technology originally developed in the project is still in use, impacts learning, teaching and working practices in healthcare practices, construction training and in the application of e-posters in academic conferences. We use the cases to identify factors during the lifetime of the project that have facilitated sustainable take up of research results, namely a flexible and collaborative project roll out, an open research process, early focus on end-users and an inclusive process of planning for impact and exploitation. Taken together, these factors suggest to look at research projects as providing flexible and networked co-creation platforms for innovation. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

However, little is known about the activities and resources involved in prototyping medical devices to improve patient care. In this paper, we refer to such activity as medical making to report findings based on a qualitative study of stakeholder engagement in physical prototyping (making) experiences. We examine perspectives from diverse stakeholders including clinicians, engineers, administrators, and medical researchers. Through 18 semi-structured interviews with medical-makers in the US and Canada, we analyze making activity in medical settings. We find that medical makers share strategies to address risks, adopt labor roles, and acquire resources within traditional medical practice. Our findings outline how medical-makers mitigate risks for patient safety, collaborate with local and global stakeholder networks, and overcome constraints of co-location and material practices. We recommend a clinician-aided software system, partially-open repositories, and a collaborative skill-sharing social network to extend their strategies in support of medical making. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","3D Printing; Clinicians; Healthcare; Innovation; Maker; Making; Medicine",""

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of awake prone positioning to prevent intubation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 in a large-scale randomised trial. Methods: In this prospective, a priori set up and defined, collaborative meta-trial of six randomised controlled open-label superiority trials, adults who required respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 were randomly assigned to awake prone positioning or standard care. Hospitals from six countries were involved: Canada, France, Ireland, Mexico, USA, Spain. Patients or their care providers were not masked to allocated treatment. The primary composite outcome was treatment failure, defined as the proportion of patients intubated or dying within 28 days of enrolment. The six trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04325906, NCT04347941, NCT04358939, NCT04395144, NCT04391140, and NCT04477655. Findings: Between April 2, 2020 and Jan 26, 2021, 1126 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to awake prone positioning (n=567) or standard care (n=559). 1121 patients (excluding five who withdrew from the study) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Treatment failure occurred in 223 (40%) of 564 patients assigned to awake prone positioning and in 257 (46%) of 557 patients assigned to standard care (relative risk 0·86 [95% CI 0·75−0·98]). The hazard ratio (HR) for intubation was 0·75 (0·62−0·91), and the HR for mortality was 0·87 (0·68−1·11) with awake prone positioning compared with standard care within 28 days of enrolment. The incidence of prespecified adverse events was low and similar in both groups. Interpretation: Awake prone positioning of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 reduces the incidence of treatment failure and the need for intubation without any signal of harm. These results support routine awake prone positioning of patients with COVID-19 who require support with high-flow nasal cannula.

Yet realizing optimal positive impact from a new technology for the widest range of individuals who would benefit remains elusive. In software and new product development, iterative rapid-cycle 'agile' methods more rapidly provide value, mitigate failure risks, and adapt to customer feedback. Co-development between builders and customers is a key agile principle. But how does one accomplish co-development with busy clinicians? In this paper, we discuss four practical agile co-development practices found helpful clinically: (1) User stories for lightweight requirements; (2) Time-boxed development for collaborative design and prompt course correction; (3) Automated acceptance test driven development, with clinician-vetted specifications; and (4) Monitoring of clinician interactions after release, for rapid-cycle product adaptation and evolution. In the coming wave of innovation in healthcare apps ushered in by open APIs to EHRs, learning rapidly what new product features work well for clinicians and patients will become even more crucial. © 2017 IEEE.","","Acceptance tests; Curricula; Health care; Iterative methods; Product development; Collaborative design; Course correction; Customer feedback; Healthcare technology; Innovative technology; New product development; Product adaptation; Test driven development; Product design"

Innovations in basic science teaching methods are needed to keep up with an ever-changing landscape of technology. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether students in a medical and dental histology course would have better grades if they used gaming software Kahoot® and whether gamification effects on learning and enjoyment. Methods: In an effort to both evoke students' interest and expand their skill retention, an online competition using Kahoot® was implemented for first-year students in 2018 (n = 215) at the University of Eastern Finland. Additionally, closed (160/215) or open-ended (41/215) feedback questions were collected and analyzed. Results: The Kahoot® gamification program was successful and resulted in learning gains. The overall participant satisfaction using Kahoot® was high, with students (124/160) indicating that gamification increased their motivation to learn. The gaming approach seemed to enable the students to overcome individual difficulties (139/160) and to set up collaboration (107/160); furthermore, gamification promoted interest (109/160), and the respondents found the immediate feedback from senior professionals to be positive (146/160). In the open-ended survey, the students (23/41) viewed collaborative team- and gamification-based learning positively. Conclusion: This study lends support to the use of gamification in the teaching of histology and may provide a foundation for designing a gamification-integrated curriculum across healthcare disciplines. © 2019 The Author(s).","Collaborative learning; Dental education; Game design; Histology education; Knowledge retention; Medical education; Whole-slide imaging platform","Academic Performance; Curriculum; Finland; Games, Experimental; Histology; Humans; Internet; Students, Medical; Teaching; adult; article; collaborative learning; competition; controlled study; curriculum; dental education; female; Finland; histology; histopathology; human; human experiment; human tissue; major clinical study; male; medical education; motivation; satisfaction; skill retention; software; student; academic achievement; curriculum; education; game; histology; Internet; medical student; teaching"

Among these new products, regenerative medicines (RMs) can potentially address many currently unmet medical needs. The field of RM includes a rapidly expanding set of innovative medical technologies that restore function by allowing the body to repair, replace, and regenerate damaged, ageing or diseased cells, tissues and organs. In spite of this potential, many companies seeking to commercialise RM technologies are struggling to raise the necessary capital. RM companies that wish to prosper in such a resource-constrained environment need to develop new business models and funding strategies. Innovative funding strategies include pursuing alternative sources of funding: (1) governmental and not-for-profit funds; (2) corporate venture funds that pursue strategic returns; (3) partnership deals with pharmaceutical companies; (4) funding through partnerships and mergers; and (5) out-licensing non-core technology or providing consulting or laboratory services. Companies can also follow a capital-efficient business models by focusing and conserving resources with: (1) the extension of technology development in an academic setting; (2) the reduction of the infrastructure and staffing; and (3) the funding of only core projects. Companies can collaborate and leverage shared resources by outsourcing components of their development to expert partners (e.g. CROs, CMOs or Regenerative Medicine Translation Centres) in a possible open innovation environment. Notwithstanding the substantial challenges that the emerging RM companies are currently facing, companies can increase their chances for success by pursuing collaborative, capital-efficient business models and alternate funding strategies. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

As a core activity of the Open-Source Value Project, the Innovation and Value Initiative develops and provides access to flexible open-source economic models that are developed iteratively based on public feedback and input. In this article, we describe our experience to date with the development of two currently released, Open-Source Value Project models, one in rheumatoid arthritis and one in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. We developed both Open-Source Value Project models using the statistical programming language R instead of spreadsheet software (i.e., Excel), which allows the models to capture multiple model structures, model sequential treatment with individual patient simulations, and improve integration with formal evidence synthesis. By developing the models in R, we were also able to use version control systems to manage changes to the source code, which is needed for iterative and collaborative model development. Similarly, Open-Source Value Project models are freely available to the public to provide maximum transparency and facilitate collaboration. Development of the rheumatoid arthritis and non-small-cell lung cancer model platforms has presented multiple challenges. The development of multiple components of the model platform tailored to different audiences, including web interfaces, required more resources than a cost-effectiveness analysis for a publication would. Furthermore, we faced methodological hurdles, in particular related to the incorporation of multiple competing model structures and novel elements of value. The iterative development based on public feedback also posed some challenges during the review phase, where methodological experts did not always understand feedback from clinicians and vice versa. Response to the Open-Source Value Project by the modeling community and patient organizations has been positive, but feedback from US decision makers has been limited to date. As we progress with this project, we hope to learn more about the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of an open-source and collaborative approach to model development for value assessment. © 2019, The Author(s).","","Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Models, Economic; United States; epidermal growth factor receptor; Article; computer language; cost effectiveness analysis; economic model; funding; health care system; health economics; human; non small cell lung cancer; patent; patient simulation; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; United States; cost benefit analysis; decision making; economics; health care delivery; lung tumor; non small cell lung cancer; organization and management; rheumatoid arthritis"

The area has received substantial public funding and support from the late 90s from the European Union Research Framework Programmes, including the currently running Horizon 2020. We undertook data collection, clustering and analysis of 119 projects (with about 500 M€ EU funding and 890 public and private organisations) covering the area of Micro-Nano-Bio-info technologies and Systems (MNBS) to document the allocation of public money spent on research, development and innovation in this field, to identify synergies, gaps and major trends as well as to verify the alignment with the relevant EU policies and define future challenges and next opportunities for support. Methodology: The projects, funded through several topics of the EC programmes, e.g. Bio-electronics, Biophotonics, Nanomedicine and Healthcare & Well-Being, have been clustered through a semi-automated process based on text mining, using RapidMiner software, with the text describing the projects and their tasks as the input. Text mining-based clustering is grounded in the words contained in the documents provided, and includes basically 2 steps: (i) document pre-processing and (ii) document clustering based on the word frequencies. The hierarchical clustering obtained provide us information related to the proximity of the projects with regard to the meaningful words related to the technologies, processes, applications, etc., which have been kept. This type of grouping provides certainty that projects are grouped with the closest projects in terms of overall content (e.g. objectives, tasks and technologies involved). Results: Classification: Eleven differentiated project categories have been defined, each containing from 6 to 17 projects. These categories can be further re-grouped in broader categories in several ways depending on the purpose, e.g. considering the link to either in-vivo (patient-centred devices) or in-vitro (portable devices and systems and analytical detection platforms) applications, to the level of portability (portable devices vs. platforms), or to the manufacturing importance. Participating (EU and non-EU) organisations include research and academic (37%), private companies (56%), end-users e.g. hospitals or clinical related institutions (4,7%) as well as public authorities and endusers associations in health, food and environment sectors (2,3%). Participation: The participants come from European countries and from Russia, Australia, Japan and the United States. The EU funding is spread all over Europe, though higher concentration is observed in the Western part of Europe. Driving forces: the large majority of projects is driven by two main requirements i.e. avoid the use of specialized laboratory-based (mainly hospital-centred), skilled labour-handled, expensive and time-consuming bio-samples and data analysis; and achieve lower cost, quasi-real-time monitoring or analysis using non-specialized infrastructures, at the Point of Care/Need (out-of-lab). Achievements and Challenges: overall the projects have delivered significant technological progress beyond the state-of-the-art and in some cases integrated prototypes have been validated at the laboratory and in fewer cases tested in real application environments. However, further R&D effort is needed in order to achieve better and compatible interfaces, higher system integration and technology readiness level, better connectivity, efficient manufacturing processes & technologies and validation in real application conditions. Additionally, a critical collaborative effort should be put on effective technology translation of research into new products, speeding up product development, market introduction and cost reduction. This should encompass product design, supply chain setup, user targeting, clinical validation, manufacturing and commercial roll-out. Conclusion: The projects′ portfolio analysis allowed sizing the EU funding and clustering of MNBS research and innovation activities, as well as identifying synergies, major trends, gaps and lessons to be learned for future public investment. Supporting further system integration and validation in real life environments as well as the creation of collaborative interdisciplinary platforms and innovation ecosystems will strongly contribute to new business and markets. It will accelerate the digitization of the European industry in key sectors like healthcare, food and security and support innovation through the full supply chains, thus will positively impact the EU's single market fit for the digital age. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.","Bio-electronics; Bio-photonics; EU research and innovation; ICT; Key enabling technologies; MNBS; Nanomedicine; Projects Analysis","Automation; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Finance; Health care; Hospitals; Investments; Manufacture; Medical nanotechnology; Photonics; Portable equipment; Product design; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Bio photonics; Enabling technologies; Hier-archical clustering; MNBS; Projects Analysis; Research and development; Technologies and systems; Technology readiness levels; Cluster analysis"

In the healthcare sector, healthcare organisations are often the core customers for companies that want to use e-health solutions to improve patient care and cost efficiency. We examined the impact of coupled open innovation on companies' business models. Co-creation between network actors was carried out in a demand-driven manner based on the needs of healthcare professionals. We present the initial findings of a longitudinal case -study in an international setting. The research generated a new, collaborative, open business modelling framework for fact-based value creation that supports companies in the challenging task of exploring economically viable business opportunities.

This paper presents results from a comprehensive baseline study carried out with 40 informants from the leadership of 19 healthcare clinics in Northern Ethiopia, Western Kenya, Southern Malawi and Eastern Cape, South Africa during November - December 2015, using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. These findings identified human resource capacity, environmental, practical and technical challenges, and equipment and infrastructure deficits. Training requirements of healthcare workers were also identified. Constraints identified include the need for: intuitive, easy-to-use user interfaces to reduce the need for extensive training; use of flexible data protocols to facilitate cost effective bandwidth and effective data exchange; cost effective; low power consumption technologies to reduce cost of replication and scaling; solar charging units to increase availability; support for sensors and telemedicine due to a deficit of healthcare professionals in rural and deep rural clinics; and the need for easy configuration and adaptation to facilitate wider adoption. This insight will be used to inform co-design of the mHealth4Afrika platform during 2016-2018, based on user-centered design principles, leveraging current state-of-the-art in terms of electronic patient record systems and medical sensors. It will also inform the minimum ICT infrastructure required in each clinic. The expected outcome is a multi-region proof of concept that can make a significant contribution in accelerating exploitation of mHealth across Africa. © 2016 IEEE.","Africa; Electronic Healthcare Records; Ethiopia; Kenya; Malawi; mHealth; Sensors; South Africa; Telemedicine","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electronic data interchange; Health care; mHealth; Sensors; Software design; Telemedicine; User interfaces; Africa; Electronic healthcare records; Ethiopia; Kenya; Malawi; South Africa; User centered design"

This successful public event, as evidenced by the participation of more than 150 attendees, with 65 % from the ultraviolet technology industry, was part of an ongoing collaborative effort between NIST and the IUVA and its affiliates to examine the measurement and standards needs for pathogen abatement with UV-C in the healthcare whole-room environment. Prior to and since this event, stakeholders from industry, academia, government, and public health services have been collaboratively engaged with NIST to accelerate the development and use of accurate measurements and models for UV-C disinfection technologies and facilitate technology transfer. The workshop served as an open forum to continue this discussion with a technical focus centered on the effective design, use, and implementation of UV-C technologies for the prevention and treatment of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in complex hospital settings. These settings include patient rooms, operating rooms, common staging areas, ventilation systems, personal protective equipment, and tools for the reprocessing and disinfecting of instruments or devices used in medical procedures, such as catheters and ventilators. The critical need for UV-C technologies for disinfection has been amplified by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), stimulating an even greater emphasis on identifying testing and performance metrology needs. This paper discusses these topics based on the international workshop and community activities since the workshop, including a public World-Wide-Web-based seminar with more than 500 registered attendees on September 30, 2020; an international conference on UV-C technologies for air and surface disinfection, December 8-9, 2020; and a webinar on returning to normalcy with the use of UV-C technologies, April 27 and 29, 2021. This article also serves as an introduction to a special section of the Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where full papers address recent technical, noncommercial, UV-C technology and pathogen-abatement investigations. The set of papers provides keen insights from the vantage points of medicine and industry. Recent technical developments, successes, and needs in optics and photonics, radiation physics, biological efficacy, and the needs of future markets in UV-C technologies are described to provide a concise compilation of the community's efforts and the state of the field. Standards needs are identified and discussed throughout this special section.

The purpose of this regional initiative was to develop a course and teaching resources to support Higher Education Institutions in the United Kingdom (UK) when embedding the World Health Organization (WHO) multiprofessional patient safety curriculum into undergraduate healthcare education. Objectives: In this pilot study, researchers assessed the impact of the interprofessional simulation-based education (IPSE) course on students’ perceptions of interprofessional learning and patient safety post-course, and explored the participants’ perceived application of knowledge and skills 3 months later. Methods: A sequential mixed-methods evaluation was conducted, including pre- and post-course Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaires and two course evaluation questionnaires featuring open and closed items (administered immediately post-course and 3 months later). Participants included undergraduate physiotherapy, medical, nursing, and pharmacy students. Results: The IPSE course enabled students to develop an appreciation of each other’s professional roles and particularly their individual and collaborative practices that may positively impact upon patient safety. Post-course students reported being able to influence patient safety through an increased application of their ability to identify errors and influence their colleagues’ practices, thus impacting directly upon patient safety. Conclusion: This paper provides an evaluation of an innovative method of providing interprofessional patient safety learning and teaching opportunities within undergraduate healthcare curricula. © 2013, © W.

The promotion of open communication and teamwork using obstetric simulation is the purpose of an innovative program introduced to our healthcare system. A new simulation lab was constructed at the College of Nursing within the system. The sister facilities are located within a 30‐mile radius and attempt to attract the same patient population. Proposed Change: An obstetric simulation planning committee was formed to include educators from the three facilities within the healthcare system. The planning committee corresponded via e‐mails and had monthly meetings to share patient safety goals and develop a comprehensive plan for incorporating simulation as an educational component for nurses working in obstetric units. Implementation, Outcomes, and Evaluation: Through scheduled monthly meetings the committee shared numerous ideas to support a fiscally responsible implementation plan. The drills are designed to enhance the learning of the nurse by incorporating the use of psychomotor skills. The nurse also will role‐play and care for a woman through the stages of labor and delivery using the simulator. Responding appropriately to spontaneous obstetric emergencies, including shoulder dystocia and precipitous delivery, are the first areas covered during the implementation of simulation. Implications for Nursing Practice: Meaningful implications for the simulation training include effective communication as an interdisciplinary team; safe collaborative care to the obstetric simulator in the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods; and incorporate the collaboration of facilities to increase competency in varying skill mixes. The labor and delivery staff nurses are required to participate in 4 hours of simulation training annually. The scheduling of nurses from three facilities will allow 16 nurses to participate in training per month. Learning modules on shoulder dystocia and precipitous delivery were constructed to optimize the learning experience for each nurse. The modules contain objectives for each simulation module, pertinent educational materials, and learning assessments. Confidence level scoring will be performed by the nurse to evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation. © 2013 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses","obstetric emergencies; patient safety; simulation; teamwork",""

Recent trends, including open innovation, collaborative engineering and the “makers” movement, are reshaping traditional engineering design and opening new horizons in many industrial fields that benefit from user-oriented designs and from creativity promotion through collaboration. The medical field, with the birth of the open-source medical device concept, can greatly benefit from the mentioned trends, although special considerations need to be taken into account. Medical devices are very special products, due to their intimate interaction with the human body and their potential risks. In consequence, even if open innovation and open-source approaches may transform biomedical engineering towards equitable access medical technologies, the transition from classical medical device development towards open-source medical devices should be managed with a focus on safety and regulation compliance. In this chapter, modern methodologies for product development are presented, and key aspects for open-source medical devices are highlighted, with the intention of providing a harmonized methodology for user-centred, safe and regulation-compliant open-source medical technologies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Biomedical engineering; Engineering design; Equitable healthcare; Open-source medical devices; Systematic development",""

Consequently, a wide set of methodologies, techniques and international standards propose strategies for detecting and minimizing design, manufacturing and operational risks and deal with the analysis and assessment of potential use errors and malfunctions during the operation of healthcare technologies. Open-source medical devices (OSMDs) are typically designed in a collaborative way, involving truly international and multicultural development teams and following development life cycles, through which the information is shared, and also manipulated and updated, within large communities of “makers”. Besides, OSMDs are sometimes manufactured and delivered through still unconventional supply chains. As compared with traditional in-house developments, open-source approaches bring new uncertainties to the process and related potential hazards, if systematic methods for promoting usability and minimizing risks are not adequately shared in the open-source community, applied and documented. At the same time, the openness of information throughout the whole development process should, ideally, promote design peer-review and failure detection at earlier stages, if the design principles for OSMDs and their special features are correctly considered.In consequence, this chapter is prepared with the intention of summarizing the more relevant techniques and standards for usability promotion and risk minimization in biomedical engineering (BME) tasks linked to healthcare technology development. In addition, the final purpose is presenting an innovative and straightforward - user-friendly - methodology for developing intrinsically safe medical technologies, based on internationally accepted techniques and standards, and directly transferable to open-source medical devices. To illustrate the described methods and techniques, several case studies for electromedical devices, invasive devices, standalone software and protecting splints, among others, are presented, which serve to give proof of the flexibility and scalability of this method. Some key aspects linked to applying these methods to projects emerging from open-innovation schemes and delivered as open-source medical devices and technologies are discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Design for usability; Open-source medical devices; Risk identification; Risk management",""

Methods: The population was all physicians and nurses (N=3,067) employed at four private hospitals that have received accreditation or the ""ISO"" certificate, and four public hospitals, all of which were located within Istanbul city limits. A proportional sample of 570 participants were selected from the eight hospitals. Data-gathering tools were information form, culture scale, and Attitude Against Change Scale (AACS). Data were evaluated by using descriptive statistics, Cronbach alpha coefficient, Chi-square test, and by t test for dependent groups, one-way variance analysis (ANOVA), and Tukey test. Findings: The lowest score averages on the AACS were found in those employed in public hospitals, in those who perceived top executives as autocrats, and in those who were unwilling to participate in quality studies. Participants in a power culture were least open to change. Conclusions: A collaborative culture was the most evident culture in private hospitals, but in public hospitals the most dominant culture was a power culture. © 2007 Sigma Theta Tau International.","Attitudes toward change; Change; Management; Organizational culture","Accreditation; Analysis of Variance; Attitude of Health Personnel; Chi-Square Distribution; Chief Executive Officers, Hospital; Competitive Behavior; Cooperative Behavior; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hospitals, Private; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Medical Staff, Hospital; Nursing Methodology Research; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Organizational Culture; Organizational Innovation; Power (Psychology); Professional Role; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Questionnaires; Turkey; accreditation; analysis of variance; article; attitude to health; behavior; chi square distribution; comparative study; competitive behavior; cooperation; factorial analysis; health care quality; health personnel attitude; hospital administrator; human; medical staff; nursing methodology research; nursing staff; organization; organization and management; private hospital; professional standard; psychological aspect; public hospital; public relations; questionnaire; Turkey (republic)"

Pressures to improve patient safety within our healthcare system are gaining momentum daily. Because AHSCs in Canada are the key organizations that are positioned regionally and nationally, where service delivery is the platform for the education of future healthcare providers, and where the development of new knowledge and innovation through research occurs, leadership for patient safety logically must emanate from them. As a primer, ACEN provides an overview of current patient safety initiatives in AHSCs to date. In addition, the following six key areas for action are identified to ensure that AHSCs continue to be leaders in delivering quality, safe healthcare in Canada. These include: (1) strategic orientation to safety culture and quality improvement, (2) open and transparent disclosure policies, (3) health human resources integral to ensuring patient safety practices, (4) effective linkages between AHSCs and academic institutions, (5) national patient safety accountability initiatives and (6) collaborative team practice.","","Academic Medical Centers; Canada; Cooperative Behavior; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Leadership; Medical Errors; Needs Assessment; Nurse Administrators; Nurse's Role; Organizational Culture; Patient Advocacy; Patient Care Team; Practice Guidelines; Safety Management; Societies, Hospital; Societies, Nursing; Total Quality Management; Truth Disclosure; Canada; cooperation; health care organization; human; interpersonal communication; leadership; medical error; needs assessment; nurse administrator; nurse attitude; nursing organization; organization; organization and management; patient advocacy; patient care; practice guideline; public relations; review; safety; statistics; total quality management; university hospital"
