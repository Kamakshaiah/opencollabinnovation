2,"The global burden of fracture-related infection (FRI) is likely to be found in countries with limited healthcare resources and strategies are needed to ensure the best available practice is context appropriate. This study has two main aims: (i) to assess the applicability of recently published expert guidance from the FRI consensus groups on the diagnosis and management of FRI to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); (ii) to summarise the available evidence on FRI, with consideration for strategies applicable to low resource settings. Data related to the International Consensus Meeting Orthopaedic Trauma Work Group and the International Fracture Related Infection Consensus Group FRI guidelines were collected including panel membership, country of origin, language of publication, open access status and impact factor of the journal of publication. The recommendations and guidelines were then summarised with specific consideration for relevance and applicability to LMICs. Barriers to implementation were explored within a group of LMIC residents and experienced workers. The authorship, evidence base and reach of the FRI consensus guidelines lack representation from low resource settings. The majority of authors (78.5-100%) are based in high-income countries and there are no low-income country collaborators listed in any of the papers. All papers are in English. The FRI consensus guidelines give a clear set of principles for the optimum management of FRI. Many of these - including the approach to diagnosis, multidisciplinary team working and some elements of surgical management - are achievable in low resource settings. Current evidence suggests that it is important that a core set of principles is prioritised but robust evidence for this is lacking. There are major organisational and infrastructure obstacles in LMICs that will make any standardisation of FRI diagnosis or management challenging. The detail of how FRI consensus principles should be applied in low resource settings requires further work. The important work presented in the current FRI consensus guidelines is relevant to low resource settings. However, leadership, collaboration, creativity and innovation will be needed to implement these strategies for communities who need it the most. © 2022. The authors. All Rights Reserved."
3,"Background and Objectives: The recent progress in medical image analysis has given birth to image-guided therapy, virtual reality and augmented reality. These among other innovations have greatly improved healthcare delivery, improved quality of life and also saved lives. The advances in Internet and network technology have produced web technologies which make it possible to offer platform or software as a service via the web, making it possible for end users to access computer resources or specialized computer tools remotely. However, the high cost of image acquisition, the limited availability of medical image analysts, and the limited collaborative efforts between medical experts and scientists are major challenges for medical image analysis in the developing world. The aim of this project was to develop a medical image e-infrastructure called Medical Image Processor and Analysis (MIPAR) to contain a repository of medical images acquired from Africa and a platform for processing medical images. Methods: The backend of MIPAR which is resident on a High-Performance Computing infrastructure was built using FutureGateway, a framework for building science gateway. The image upload and download module was built upon the framework of Open Access Repository with the front end developed using HTML, CSS and BootStrap. JavaScript and JQuery were used for scripting. User's access to the server is controlled with HTTP response and a Client-Server Architecture, while the image processing tools on the server side communicate with PHP using Representational State Architecture (REST) API. Results: MIPAR was tested using brain MRI images. Images were submitted remotely via MIPAR's web interface and kept in the repository. Image processing facility of MIPAR was tested using the brain extraction module, a 3D image of approximately 43MB was successfully brain extracted within 60 s. Conclusion: MIPAR allows users to donate, download and process medical images at no cost. It is our hope that such useful and unique tool will encourage collaboration, improve diagnosis, improve patient management, and promote open science in Africa. © 2018"
4,"Purpose: Technical solutions could facilitate activities and participation in individuals with disabilities. For the development of solutions, hackathons are a method of interdisciplinary collaboration. For hackathon, the definition of pain points that require solutions is crucial. We aimed to determine engineers’ preferences and expectations regarding pain point qualities. Methods: We used a collaborative approach involving individuals with disability, families, and healthcare professionals to determine pain points for use by engineering students during a disability Hackathon. A pain point bank was built using 3 upstream sources: a survey (350 responses, 20 pain points selected), interviews (8 children, 13 pain points), and a multidisciplinary workshop based on design thinking methods (45 people, 32 pain points). A fourth source was 20 adults with disabilities present during the Hackathon. Engineering students rated pain point qualities from each source in a questionnaire that included closed questions relating to predefined criteria: achievability, specificity, relevance and attractiveness and open questions to collect non-predefined quality criteria. Results: Pain points from the workshop were most frequently used (48%); followed by on-site discussions with mentors (43%), the survey (38%), and interviews (31%). On-site discussions received the highest quality ratings followed by the workshop, survey, and interviews. Three quality criteria emerged from the responses to open questions: “representative”, “empathy”, and “real-need”. Conclusions: To be actionable by engineers, pain points must relate to real needs, be achievable, specific, relevant and attractive but also representative and arouse empathy. We devised a checklist of qualities along with a toolbox of methods to achieve each.Implications For Rehabilitation The first step of the development of technical solutions for children and individuals with disabilities is the identification of their needs and their adequate formulation to be submitted to technical solutions providers. Daily life needs of individuals with disability were gathered for an engineering hackathon and proposed as pain points to 400 engineering students. To facilitate the development of solutions by engineers, pain points must relate to real needs, be specific, relevant, achievable and attractive; be representative and arouse empathy; a toolbox of needs collection methods is proposed to achieve each of those qualities. Discussions with individuals with disability and health professionals should be provided. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

6,"Digital Health is a subject of extensive discourse when considering its current and future significance. This significance arises from a convergence of various factors, including the escalating capabilities and cost-effectiveness of computing and communication technology, coupled with the mounting demands and challenges faced by healthcare systems. The integration of health and technology, when studied collectively with the purpose of addressing tangible real-world issues, holds the potential to generate substantial outcomes that greatly influence the provision of clinical and social care, thereby enhancing the overall well-being of both individuals and populations. In this sense, in this paper we propose a collaborative approach, using Open Innovation, where the most relevant stakeholders—health and care professionals, citizens and companies—work together to develop and validate innovative digital solutions for health and care. We have called this approach of value co-creation the Collaborative Ecosystem, and we focus specifically on the potential development of the Regional Ecosystem for Collaborative Innovation in Digital Health and Care, and the envisioned implications of its implementation in economic and social dimensions. 2023 Carrilho, Videira, Campos, Midão and Costa."
7,"mHealth4Afrika is a collaborative research and innovation project, co-funded under Horizon 2020. It is focused on supporting Sustainable Development Goal 3 and Horizon 2020 Societal challenges by developing, researching and evaluating the potential impact of co-designing an open source, multilingual enabled mHealth platform to support quality community-based primary maternal healthcare delivery at semi-urban, rural and deep rural clinics, based on end-user requirements in Southern Africa (Malawi, South Africa), East Africa (Kenya) & Horn of Africa (Ethiopia). This paper aims to share the co-design process applied to develop and validate the alpha prototype, and the implications this had on the design of the beta platform. The validation of the alpha prototype was undertaken with 49 participants from 14 healthcare clinics across Northern Ethiopia, Western Kenya, Southern Malawi and Eastern Cape, South Africa during November-December 2016, using a mix of observation and semi-structured interviews. These findings have informed the co-design of the mHealth4Afrika beta platform, which will be installed in participating clinics on a phased basis during Q3 2017. The expected outcome is a multi-region proof of concept that can make a significant contribution in accelerating exploitation of mHealth across Africa. © 2017 IEEE."

9,"The open innovation hub Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform (DHPSP) was recently established with the purpose to invigorate collaborative scientific research and the development of new digital products and personalized solutions aiming to improve human health and patient safety. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a Twitter-based campaign centered on using the hashtag #DHPSP to promote the visibility of the DHPSP initiative. Thus, tweets containing #DHPSP were monitored for five weeks for the period 20.10.2020–24.11.2020 and were analyzed with Symplur Signals (social media analytics tool). In the study period, a total of 11,005 tweets containing #DHPSP were posted by 3020 Twitter users, generating 151,984,378 impressions. Analysis of the healthcare stakeholder-identity of the Twitter users who used #DHPSP revealed that the most of participating user accounts belonged to individuals or doctors, with the top three user locations being the United States (501 users), the United Kingdom (155 users), and India (121 users). Analysis of co-occurring hashtags and the full text of the posted tweets further revealed that the major themes of attention in the #DHPSP Twitter-community were related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), medicine and health, digital health technologies, and science communication in general. Overall, these results indicate that the #DHPSP initiative achieved high visibility and engaged a large body of Twitter users interested in the DHPSP focus area. Moreover, the conducted campaign resulted in an increase of DHPSP member enrollments and website visitors, and new scientific collaborations were formed. Thus, Twitter campaigns centered on a dedicated hashtag prove to be a highly efficient tool for visibility-promotion, which could be successfully utilized by healthcare-related open innovation platforms or initiatives. © 2021 The Author(s)"
10,"Successful medical technologies rely on adequately detecting unsolved or partially solved socially relevant medical challenges or needs. Identifying such needs in a precise way and specifying the medical device requirements constitute the planning stage, which is fundamental for the success of any engineering products, processes or systems under development. In our continuously changing and extremely diverse societies, a shift of trend can be appreciated in several design areas, which now benefit from the collaborative efforts of co-creators and from bottom-up innovation strategies. Indeed, traditional in-house innovation lacks dynamism, creative power and attention to end users’ needs, as compared with more recent open-innovation environments. In the medical industry, the emergent area of open-source medical devices, developed in collaboration and shared with colleagues, medical professionals, patients and patient associations and citizens, can benefit from the employment of systematic needs identification techniques oriented to bottom-up strategies. In the chapter, we present some options for a methodical identification of needs, as a support to getting started with open-source medical device projects. We illustrate such techniques by means of selected cases of studies, in which the potentials of an intimate collaboration with medical professionals, patients and patients associations are put forward. Besides, the relevance of bridging the gap between academia, industry, healthcare professionals and patients is discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."

12,"In recent decades several major changes in computer and communication technology have pushed the limits of imaging informatics and PACS beyond the traditional system architecture providing new perspectives and innovative approach to a traditionally conservative medical community. Disruptive technologies such as the world-wide-web, wireless networking, Open Source software and recent emergence of cyber communities and social networks have imposed an accelerated pace and major quantum leaps in the progress of computer and technology infrastructure applicable to medical imaging applications. Methods: This paper reviews the impact and potential benefits of two major trends in consumer market software development and how they will influence the future of medical imaging informatics. Open Source software is emerging as an attractive and cost effective alternative to traditional commercial software developments and collaborative social networks provide a new model of communication that is better suited to the needs of the medical community. Observations: Evidence shows that successful Open Source software tools have penetrated the medical market and have proven to be more robust and cost effective than their commercial counterparts. Developed by developers that are themselves part of the user community, these tools are usually better adapted to the user's need and are more robust than traditional software programs being developed and tested by a large number of contributing users. This context allows a much faster and more appropriate development and evolution of the software platforms. Similarly, communication technology has opened up to the general public in a way that has changed the social behavior and habits adding a new dimension to the way people communicate and interact with each other. The new paradigms have also slowly penetrated the professional market and ultimately the medical community. Secure social networks allowing groups of people to easily communicate and exchange information is a new model that is particularly suitable for some specific groups of healthcare professional and for physicians. It has also changed the expectations of how patients wish to communicate with their physicians. Conclusion: Emerging disruptive technologies and innovative paradigm such as Open Source software are leading the way to a new generation of information systems that slowly will change the way physicians and healthcare providers as well as patients will interact and communicate in the future. The impact of these new technologies is particularly effective in image communication, PACS and teleradiology. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
13,"eHealth innovations promise to address the many challenges to the welfare system posed by demographic changes in the population, by connecting services from different organizations through collaborative online networks. Open innovation and co-creating with partners and healthcare users may boost such transformations, but there is has been a gap in literature on how Open innovation can be managed in a public sector healthcare setting; how it's principles can help overcoming inertia, achieving functional fit and creating new values for healthcare users and benefits for the organization.

14,"In this chapter, the authors explore collective entrepreneurship through the lens of how public entrepreneurship boosts collective action towards a common good. The role of public entrepreneurs and the collaborative nature of innovation community members evidence a collective action that pursues a socio-political change. Through a case study contextualized during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in Spain, the authors explore how a public entrepreneur triggered a collective action that led to the creation of the innovation community: The Coronavirus makers. This collaborative network groups more than 20,000 researchers, developers, and engineers. They altruistically put their knowledge and resources at the service of the community to provide solutions for one of the healthcare system's main problems at that time - the shortage of medical supplies to cope with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. The collective action of the Coronavirus makers has impacted the health and wellbeing fields, the community and the values that should define social change and allow the construction of a more open, equitable and sustainable society. Potentially, our findings confirm that collective entrepreneurship derives from a function of collective action. © 2023 by Emerald Publishing Limited. All rights reserved."
15,"Open dialog is both a therapeutic approach and a way of organizing the system of mental healthcare that has been evolving in Finland since the 1980s. In Vermont, over the last decade, there has been an organic statewide effort to begin to integrate dialogic principles into the public system of mental healthcare. Because of the organic nature of these initiatives, there have not been coordinated systemic changes to support dialogic practices. To learn what visions participants in dialogically informed practice contexts have for the future as well as what structural innovations would support these visions anticipation dialogs were offered at three dialogically informed community mental health centers and one public psychiatric. The anticipation dialog was developed in Finland during the late 1980s to aid stuck professional and social networks in finding ways to move forward looking back from an imagined positive future. Twenty-seven multidisciplinary staff members and one service recipient participated in the dialogs. The authors conducted a multi-step process of thematic discourse analysis of all 4 anticipation dialogs. Findings underscore dilemmas entailed in growing a dialogic practice system, including the toll systemic uncertainty takes on workers in the system and the simultaneous pull to offer some amount of open-endedness to the system change process in the spirit of inclusiveness, mutual trust, democracy, and reducing hierarchy. Other key findings influencing sustainability of dialogic practices in community mental health include integrating dialogic work into roles rather than adding them to existing responsibilities. Our experiences indicate that anticipation dialogs may be a way of conducting systemic research that contributes to the forward momentum of system innovation. Offering a greater length of time for organizational anticipation dialogs would be valuable, as would centering the voices of clients and their networks.

16,"Service design provides the means to make sense of the complex interactions and processes experienced when delivering and receiving patient care. The tools of service design generate visual narratives that communicate experiences of and interactions between medical staff, hospital patients and carers, as well as mapping processes and systems and identifying the nature of relationships between the various stakeholders involved. Often service design tools are used to communicate what was observed and what might be done, but when used as analytical and diagnostic tools, they deliver a powerful means of sharing thinking and decision-making across a wider community beyond the designers themselves. The authors discuss the application of human-centric service design, not only as the means to design innovative service outcomes but to analyse and diagnose the complex processes involved in delivering patient care. The utilisation of this multifaceted design process resulted in richer service prognosis and propositions in concordance with the needs of patients, carers, hospital staff and clinicians than often provided by the more routine qualitative or quantitative analysis of service delivery. Using case studies of projects undertaken at University Hospital Crosshouse to illustrate our findings, this chapter explores the issues encountered during the application of service design and service thinking by clinical and non-clinical professionals, including the lessons learned in developing sustainable innovation practices that reduced reliance on the presence of designers. We highlight the dynamics of this approach, looking through the lens of person-centred service design and open innovation, how staff and service users engaged in exploring new insights and approaches. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019."
17,"Rising healthcare costs and vast business opportunities in health markets have resulted in a great demand to enhance innovation creation. However, innovation development in healthcare is challenging because of the fragmented and complicated context. Potential means to tackle the challenges include utilising the concepts of open innovation and co-creation, which require organisations to develop new roles and relationships with multiple stakeholders. This paper analyses a 12-month co-creation project where a new collaboration model for healthcare innovations was developed by a hospital, research partners, and companies. We demonstrate how organisations experiment with collaborative innovation in the healthcare context, and what was learned from this experimentation. The study utilises an action research approach and a case study strategy.

20,"Purpose: The Living Lab concept of a collaborative setup for users to shape technology and its applications can generate new understandings of future business opportunities1. However, implementing Living Lab concepts requires a very open approach that sometimes contradicts a company's specific business model. Our project uses the concept of Living Labs to create a systematic and participatory approach to providing health care and strengthening community ties in tribal areas. This is, in fact, a regional planning project. Its open innovation platform incorporates three core functions: putting an IT platform for healthcare management in place, providing medical devices for home care through existing eldercare services, and situating communication devices to make daily life more convenient and facilitate tribal community building2-4. Method: We are establishing an experimental field for smart technologies designed to assist indigenous elderly in Nan-ao Township in cooperation with Saint Mary's Hospital Luodong, the Health Bureau of Yilan County, leading tele-care companies, the health care device industry, tribal leaders and community health networks. A university-based community partnership serves as a mediator, reducing health gaps in the region. Empowerment and user-driven innovation are key concepts to develop new service and business models. Research team members, working with tribal device users, design ICT products through a mutually supportive, participatory approach. At the same time, an innovative, foundational platform for promoting community health will be established by all stake holders in this indigenous tribe5. Eight community leaders and around 30 residents have taken part in this project. Results & Discussion: We designed a Living Lab with an e-learning platform to link social networking activity, detailed oral history data archives, and health promotion/rehabilitation activities with health data collections. The data collections were organized through health-related activities, coordinated mainly by the research team and the tribal association leaders. In this system, the community becomes a basic unit for developing self-sustained business and distributing neighborhood health information. Such neighborhoods may turn out to be both mobilization units and Living Labs for gathering data on local culture and eco-region planning."
21,"Competent educators are needed to ensure that social and healthcare professionals are effective and highly competent. However, there is too little evidence-based knowledge of current and required enhancements of educators' competences in this field. The aim of this study was to describe social and healthcare educators’ perceptions of their competence in education. The study had a qualitative design, based on interviews with educators and rooted in critical realism. Forty-eight participants were recruited from seven universities of applied sciences and two vocational colleges in Finland, with the assistance of contact persons nominated by the institutions. The inclusion criterion for participation was employment by an educational institution as a part-time or full-time, social and/or healthcare educator. Data were collected in the period February–April 2018. The participants were interviewed in 16 focus groups with two to five participants per group. The acquired data were subjected to inductive content analysis, which yielded 506 open codes, 48 sub-categories, nine categories and one main category. The educators’ competence was defined as a multidimensional construct, including categories of educators’ competences in practicing as an educator, subject, ethics, pedagogy, management and organisation, innovation and development, collaboration, handling cultural and linguistic diversity, and continuous professional development. Educators recognised the need for developing competence in innovation to meet rapid changes in a competitive and increasingly global sociopolitical environment. Enhancement of adaptability to rapid changes was recognised as a necessity. The findings have social value in identifying requirements to improve social and healthcare educators' competence by helping educational leadership to improve educational standards, construct a continuous education framework and create national and/or international curricula for teacher education degree programs to enhance the quality of education. We also suggest that educational leadership needs to establish, maintain and strengthen collaborative strategies to provide effective, adaptable support systems, involving educators and students, in their working practices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"
22,"Sustainability science has been gaining traction within academic research and teaching over the past few decades, and it is now entering a phase of greater maturity as a discipline, with links to sectors beyond the academy including energy, finance, advocacy, development, design, construction, agriculture, and healthcare. Concurrently, the growth of the internet has spurred innovation in platform development. This convergence has generated technology-enabled opportunities for training sustainability scholars and practitioners grounded in active learning pedagogies. Case studies are one active learning strategy becoming established within the fields of environment and sustainability. However, the traditional case study form and mode of delivery, which excel at a retroactive analysis of strategic decision-making and outcomes, can create challenges for teaching about issues involving emergent technologies and rapidly changing scientific and social dimensions. This article describes one novel platform, called Gala, for teaching and learning about sustainability science through case studies that address these challenges. Gala closely integrates text and multimedia components, is easily updated, and embraces content consumers as content creators and vice versa. We also report here the results of one pilot study that investigated differences between graduate and undergraduate student interactions with different case components. Results indicate that both groups heavily used the case narrative, but varied in their use of multimedia components. Such insights into patterns of case use are informing decisions about improvements to Gala and directions for future case production, teaching, and assessment, in order to create better tools for teaching and learning about sustainability.  © 2008-2011 IEEE."
23,"mHealth4Afrika has co-designed and validated a standards-based, comprehensive patient-centric health platform for use in resource constrained environments around the world. Suppored by the European Commission under Horizon 2020, mHealth4Afrika was co=designed to be adaptable and extensible, modular and multilingual. mHealth4Afrika integrates Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) functionality with the use of medical sensors and analytical, data visualisation and decision support tools at the point of care. It supports automatic counting of aggregate program indicator data required by Ministries of Health and SMS appointment notifications to encourage attendance at medical appointments. HL7 FHIR integration has also been undertaken to support transfer of vital sign readings from CE approved medical sensors, lab system data exchange, and the ability to import and export individal patient records to support patient mobility. mHealth4Afrika has leveraged a user-centred design and Collaborative Open Innovation based approach, working in partnership with Ministries of Health, District Health Offices, Clinics Managers and healthcare professionals in healthcare facilities in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and South Africa to inform required functionality, workflow and usability requirements. Following three years of co-design, alpha and beta development, the pilot platform was formally validated in real-life environments by 101 healthcare professionals from 13 of the 23 intervention health facilities in Northwest Ethiopia, Western Kenya and Southern Malawi and 28 clinicians from South Africa, between October 2018 and April 2019. The feedback received was very positive. © 2019 IEEE."
24,"The digital footprint marks all parts of society and impacts our lifestyles. Beyond perceived changes in individual way of life, digital revolution also affects sociotechnical systems, collective structures or communities that delivers primary services for citizens. Healthcare is deeply impacted by such a digital mutation at many levels (patient expectations, caregivers practices and organization). We are probably witnessing the emergence of smart and personalized healthcare with a very large scope. To be included in this dynamics, many healthcare organizations now feature collaborative approaches and open innovation management to improve their performance in a sustainable perspective. But the complexity of systems is often a limit to their progress. This paper discuss the place and role that could be played by new utilities that are naturally based on open innovation approach: the living labs. In connected health where many stakeholders should interact, they are naturally expanding. Using an example, we show the gains in value chain that this new envision of open innovation could provide. In parallel, the paper argues for a development of open innovation engineering in such labs. It leads to the conclusion that a reference framework is helpful in such a perspective. © 2017 IEEE."

26,"This article illustrates the connections between collaborative interactions and both social and organizational transformations that are affecting practices of care and healthcare organizations. On the basis of empirical data collected through 13 focus groups in an Italian hospital, it is meant to show how collaboration can be linked to three main metaphors, each of them matching specific forms of social and professional interactions. The three metaphors of collaboration constitute different attempts to interpret social and organizational changes in proactive terms, encouraging social innovation, or in defensive terms, as action of cultural resistance. The three metaphors are: the apparatus, the family and the team. In different ways, the first two represent forms of resistance to change and they are widely present within the organization. The last, instead, consists of a proactive way to face ongoing social and organizational change. This metaphor circulates in limited settings within the organization but it testifies the existence of a different prospective to look at collaborative interactions, a prospective related to specific combinations of organizational and professional characteristics. The three metaphors indicates that organizational change and collaboration can be strengthen by facilitating open, plural and heterogeneous professional settings."
27,"Three-dimensional files featuring patients’ geometry can be obtained through common tools in dental practice, such as an intraoral scanner (IOS) or Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). The use of 3D files in medical education is promoted, but only few methodologies were reported due to the lack of ease to use and accessible protocols for educators. The aim of this work was to present innovative and accessible methodologies to create 3D files in dental education. The first step requires the definition of the educational outcomes and the situations of interest. The second step relies on the use of IOS and CBCT to digitize the content. The last “post-treatment” steps involve free software for analysis of quality, re-meshing and simplifying the file in accordance with the desired educational activity. Several examples of educational activities using 3D files are illustrated in dental education and discussed. Three-dimensional files open up many accessible applications for a dental educator, but further investigations are required to develop collaborative tools and prevent educational inequalities between establishments. © 2021 by the authors.

28,"Ongoing assessment of the biomedical engineering concentration in the Department of Engineering at East Carolina University, suggested that undergraduate students had difficulty adequately translating technical course content to real world biomedical engineering problems. East Carolina University is home to the Department of Engineering, Brody School of Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Allied Health Sciences, and is affiliated with a large regional medical center. Taking advantage of these resources, the goal of this project was to develop a multidisciplinary, collaborative educational experience, in a clinical environment, to improve student learning. Our objectives were to provide undergraduate engineering students with an understanding and appreciation of the needs and uses of technology in healthcare and to foster innovation in medical technology. The ""Special Topics in Engineering Biomedical Innovation"" course serves as an engineering technical elective, targeted to junior and senior undergraduates. The course was first offered in spring 2016 and includes a didactic component, observation component and team based project. Students receive instruction in observation techniques, clinical environments, professional behavior, entrepreneurship, technology transfer, and intellectual property. Clinic rotations focus on identifying unmet clinical needs with projects aimed at developing and designing a solution. In 2017, a new collaboration with the College of Business Miller School of Entrepreneurship was initiated. At the end of the term, the combined engineering and business teams pitch their ideas to a group of investors and clinic sponsors. Evaluation of the course is based on assessment of student surveys, project reports, presentations and clinic sponsor feedback. A total of 14 students have participated in the course. Student surveys were overwhelmingly positive, identifying course strengths in critical and innovative thinking, development of observation skills, applied engineering, and clinical exposure. Suggested course improvements include more scheduled project work time, access to engineering fabrication lab, and better coordination with the business students. Clinic sponsors rated the students good to excellent for professionalism, timeliness, respect for patients, asking questions, respect for clinic staff and preparedness. In summary, a new course, using a multidisciplinary team approach was developed that provided students with clinical experiences and the opportunities to identify and solve real world problems. New collaborations with the Health Sciences Campus and College of Business were established and will continue to be developed. Benefits of this course are the generation of novel, multidisciplinary capstone project ideas and new collaborative opportunities. Overall this course illustrates the importance of providing undergraduate students open-ended, loosely defined projects, and allowing project teams to assume responsibility for design and innovation. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018."
29,"mHealth4Afrika is a collaborative research and innovation project, focused on supporting Horizon 2020 Societal challenges and Sustainable Development Goal 3. It is researching and evaluating the potential impact of co-designing and developing an open source, multilingual enabled mHealth platform to support quality community-based primary maternal healthcare delivery at semi-urban, rural and deep rural clinics, based on end-user requirements in Southern Africa (Malawi, South Africa), East Africa (Kenya) Horn of Africa (Ethiopia). This paper aims to share the co-design process applied to develop and validate Beta platform v1, and the implications this had on the design of subsequent iterations of the beta platform. The Beta platform v1 validation was undertaken with 36 participants from 11 healthcare clinics across Northern Ethiopia, Western Kenya, Southern Malawi and Eastern Cape, South Africa during November-December 2017, using a mix of ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews. These findings have informed the co-design of the subsequent iterations of the mHealth4Afrika beta platform, which is being used in the participating clinics on a phased basis during Q3-Q4 2018. This platform integrates Electronic Medical Records, Electronic Health Records, medical sensors, visualisation and automatically generate monthly health indicators, thus supporting better clinical care and decision making, and freeing up time for clinical care and continuous professional medical education, thus reducing mortality rates. The expected outcome is a multi-region proof of concept that can make a significant contribution in accelerating exploitation of mHealth across Africa to improve health outcomes and stregthen health systems. © 2018 IEEE."

32,"For addressing grand challenges, in recent decades, we have seen a growing focus on collaborative innovation in the public sector. However, despite important work, current research is paying relatively little attention to what facets of collaborative innovation are relevant and how they enhance the required innovative performance. To face the grand challenge of public safety, international military organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), need to pursue a collaborative innovation process. In this study, we open up the black box of collaborative innovation by unraveling three critical mechanisms that improve a public organization&#x0027;s innovation performance. Our specific aim was to unfold the ways that Transactive Memory (i.e., knowing who knows what), Knowledge Sharing, and Learning From Failure affect innovation performance. We do this by examining 166 responses from multiple innovation teams at NATO, Ministries of Defense, and Centers of Excellence. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the knowledge coordination aspect of Transactive Memory and learning from others&#x2019; failures enhance innovation performance. Surprisingly, the effect of knowledge sharing on innovation performance is nonexistent and fully mediated by learning from failure. So, we contribute by unraveling how these three critical mechanisms influence innovation performance in a public organization. Future research could validate our findings in different public sector contexts (e.g., healthcare), focus on transactive memory&#x0027;s role in relation to the two sides of knowledge sharing (sending and receiving), and further examine how knowledge sharing impacts innovation performance in a public military context.

33,"A virtual exchange involving 133 undergraduate STEM students in the US, Lebanon, Denmark, and Nepal was completed in the Summer of 2020. The goal of the program was to guide students through a collaborative design process where they experience working productively with people whose cultural backgrounds were different from their own. Groups of 4-5 students worked with a facilitator over 5-6 weeks. The course has an asynchronous and synchronous component to accommodate different time zones and schedules. A series of 5 video lectures guided students' learning along the design path. The students were directed to download a set of notes with blanks and encouraged to actively listen by filling in the notes while watching the lecture. The length of the video lectures ranges from 8 - 32 minutes. A set of 5 individual assignments (in the form of on-line quizzes) were created to support the asynchronous activities. After watching the video lecture, students are directed to complete a quiz. Responses to short-answer questions covered in the lecture and reflective exercises are collected. Students are given 1 week to complete the activity which can be asynchronously. For each of the 5 weeks the student team also worked on group assignments. Models and templates of the group assignments were created to help the student teams respond to the open-ended design process. The culminating activity for the team was to create a video presentation describing their healthcare innovation and the supporting research collected during the program. IRB approval was obtained, and subject informed consent was requested as a prerequisite to participation in this study. A global competency survey regarding “Cross-Cultural Collaboration” was requested from each participating student at the beginning and end of the program. Students were invited to participate in a one-on-one interview, and artifacts associated with the design process (both individual and group assignments) were collected. This paper discusses the students' assessment of the growth in global competency and collaboration skills. the transition from an in-person to a remote learning program, lessons learned from virtual exchange, and suggestions for future program designs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021"
34,"Background: Emergency department (ED) use is often viewed as an indicator of health system quality. ED use for mental health (MH) reasons is increasing and costly for health systems, patients, and their families. Patients with mental disorders (MD) including substance use disorders (SUD) and suicidal behaviors are high ED users. Improving ED services for these patients and their families, and developing alternatives to ED use are thus key issues. This study aimed to: (1) describe the implementation of three innovative interventions provided by a brief intervention team, crisis center team, and family-peer support team in a Quebec psychiatric ED, including the identification of implementation barriers, and (2) evaluate the impacts of these ED innovations on MH service use and response to needs. Method: Using mixed methods with data triangulation, the implementation and impact of the three above-named ED interventions were studied. Quantitative data were collected from 101 participants (81 patients, 20 family members) using a user questionnaire and patient medical records. Qualitative data were gathered from focus groups (n = 3) with key intervention staff members (n = 14). The user questionnaire also included open-ended questions. Descriptive, comparative and content analyses were produced. Results: Key implementation issues were identified in relation to system, organizational and patient profiles, similar to results identified in most studies in the ED implementation literature aimed at improving responsiveness to patients with MD. Results were encouraging, as the innovations had a significant impact for improved patient MH service use and adequacy of care. Services also seemed adapted to patient profiles. Family members were grateful for the help received in the ED. Conclusions: Before implementing innovations, managers need to recognize the basic issues common to all new healthcare interventions: the need for staff training and strong involvement, particularly among physicians, development of collaborative tools especially in cases of potential cultural clash between staff and organizations, and continuous quality assessment. Future research needs to confirm the pertinence of these interventions, especially use of family-peer support teams in ED, as a highly innovative intervention.

Design A classic eDelphi completed in three rounds, conducted as the launch study to a multiphase national project (evaluating follow-up and complexity in cancer clinical trials). Setting Multicentre online survey involving professionals at National Health Service secondary care hospital sites in Scotland and England varied in scale, geographical location and patient populations. Participants Principal investigators at 13 hospitals across nine clinical research networks recruited 33 participants using pre-defined eligibility criteria to form a multidisciplinary panel. Main outcome measures Statements achieving a consensus level of 70% on a 7-point Likert-type scale and ranked trial rating indicators (TRIs) developed by research professionals. Results The panel developed 75 consensus statements illustrating factors contributing to complexity, follow-up intensity and operational performance in trial delivery, and specified 14 ranked TRIs. Seven open questions in the first qualitative round generated 531 individual statements. Iterative survey rounds returned rates of 82%, 82% and 93%. Conclusions Clinical trials operate within a dynamic, complex healthcare and innovation system where rapid scientific advances present opportunities and challenges for delivery organisations and professionals. Panellists highlighted cultural and organisational factors limiting the profession's potential to support growing trial complexity and patient follow-up. Enhanced communication, interoperability, funding and capacity have emerged as key priorities. Future operational models should test dialectic Singerian-based approaches respecting open dialogue and shared values. Research capacity building should prioritise innovative, collaborative approaches embedding validated review and evaluation models to understand changing operational needs and challenges. TRACAT provides a mechanism for continual knowledge assimilation to improve decision-making. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

39,"This study investigated a case of Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), a tumor profiling test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017, to examine what factors would contribute to healthcare innovation. First, we set the following three parameters to observe cases: (i) the FDA regulatory reforms, (ii) early application of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), to both research and clinical settings, and (iii) accumulation of open data. Then, we performed a comparative analysis of MSK-IMPACT with FoundationOne CDx and Oncomine Dx Target Test, both of which were FDA-approved tumor profiling tests launched in 2017. As a result, we found that MSK-IMPACT secures neutrality as a non-profit organization, achieves the active incorporation of basic research results, and performs superiorly in clinical operations, such as patient enrollment. On the contrary, we confirmed that FoundationOne CDx was the most prominent case in terms of the number of new drugs and expanded indications approved in which the FDA’s expedited approval programs were considerably utilized. Consequently, to uncover the full potential of MSK-IMPACT, it is suggested that more intersectoral collaborative activities between various healthcare stakeholders, in particular, pharmaceutical companies, for driving clinical development must be carried out based on an organizational framework that facilitates collaboration. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

41,"Pharmacists are an important source of support for people with learning disabilities, healthcare professionals and carers. Pharmacists can support carers and healthcare professionals to manage medicines in line with stopping over-medication of people with a learning disability, autism or both principles. Healthcare staff and carers were interviewed to see how they felt about working with a pharmacist and how this helped them to look after people with learning disabilities. Healthcare professionals and carers felt that the pharmacist was very helpful and listened to them. Abstract: Background The issues surrounding the prescribing and monitoring of medications for people with learning disabilities and behaviours deemed to be challenging, and are complex in their management for patients, healthcare professionals and carers. The aim of the study was to explore the impact of the pharmacist independent prescriber on a medication clinic for people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours from the perspectives of healthcare professionals and carers in a UK mental health Trust setting. Materials and Methods Qualitative methods were used to provide an understanding of the participants' interactions with the pharmacist in the context of the medication clinic. Individual, semi-structured interviews were carried out with staff and carers, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was carried out to identify themes which illuminated the participants' experiences. Recruitment took place December 2017–August 2018. Results Nine participants took part (six staff and three full-time carers). Eight themes were constructed from the data: five from staff and three from the carer cohort: being open to innovation and change in collaborative practice, challenging traditional norms in collaborative approaches to person-centred care, proactive empowerment via maximisation of expertise and resources, supporting and empowering informed decision-making, encouraging collaborative debate around medication, establishing authentic and interactive dialogue, gaining trust of the pharmacist independent prescriber's role in the management of patients and feeling empowered to challenge ambiguity and inconsistency in prescribing practice. Conclusion The pharmacist independent prescriber is a valued asset, with high levels of interaction between all staff, carers and an integral aspect of services provided. © 2020 The Authors.

42,"Across many sectors, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare to transportation, there is growing interest in the potential impact of automation that is truly collaborative with humans. Realizing this impact, though, rests on first addressing the fundamental challenge of designing automation to be aware of, and responsive to, the human with whom it is interacting. While a significant body of work exists in intent inference based on human motion, a human's physical actions alone are not necessarily a predictor of their decision-making. Indeed, cognitive factors, such as trust and workload, play a substantial role in their decision making as it relates to interactions with autonomous systems. While these factors have long been studied by cognitive psychologists and human factors experts, consideration of them in the context of closed-loop interactions between humans and autonomous systems remains a nascent area of research. In this chapter, parameterized and data-driven modeling frameworks are presented for quantifying input–output relationships as they relate to dynamic cognitive states, particularly human trust. Innovations in human subject experiment design needed to not only generate essential training data but also validate models and subsequent control policies are also discussed. The third topic of discussion is the design of algorithms to govern closed-loop interactions based on calibration of human cognitive states. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of open challenges and opportunities for further investigation on these topics. © 2023 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

44,"Background: Governing interprofessional elderly care requires the commitment of many different organisations connected in mandated collaboratives. Research over a decade ago showed that the governance relied on clan-based mechanisms, while lacking formal rules and incentives for collaborations. Awareness and reflection were seen as first steps towards progression. We aim to identify critical governance features of contemporary mandated collaboratives by discussing cases introduced by the healthcare professionals and managers themselves. Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 24) with two regional mandated collaboratives took place from November 2019 to November 2020 in the Netherlands to learn more about critical governance features. The interviews were thematically analysed by the project team (authors) to synthesise the results and were subsequently validated during a focus group. Results: Critical governance features of interorganisational activities in mandated collaboratives include the gradual formulation of shared vision and clear client-centred goals, building trust and acquaintanceship for the advancement of an open collaborative culture, establishing a non-extreme formalised governance structure through leadership, mutual trust and innovation support and facilitating information exchange and formalisation tools for optimal elderly care. Conclusion: Trust and leadership form the backbone of interorganisational functioning. Interorganisational functioning should be seen in light of their national embedment and resources that are (being made) available, which makes them susceptible to constant change as they struggle with balancing between critical features in a fluid and intermingled governance context. The identified critical features of (contemporary) mandated collaboratives may aid in assessing and improving interprofessional functioning within integrated elderly care. International debate on governance expectations of mandated collaboratives may further contribute to sharpening the roles of both managers and healthcare professionals. © 2023, The Author(s)."

46,"Jagriti Innovations developed a collaboration tool in partnership with the Cure2Children Foundation that has been used by health professionals in Italy, Pakistan, and India for the collaborative management of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for thalassemia major since August 2008. This online openaccess database covers data recording, analyzing, and reporting besides enabling knowledge exchange, telemedicine, capacity building, and quality assurance. As of February 2014, over 2400 patients have been registered and 112 BMTs have been performed with outcomes comparable to international standards, but at a fraction of the cost. This approach avoids medical emigration and contributes to local healthcare strengthening and competitiveness. This paper presents the experience and clinical outcomes associated with the use of this platform built using open-source tools and focusing on a locally pertinent tertiary care procedure-BMT."
47,"Due to profound changes occurring in biomedical knowledge and in health systems worldwide, an entirely new health and social care scenario is emerging. Moreover, the enormous technological potential developed over the last years is increasingly influencing life sciences and driving changes toward personalized medicine and value-based healthcare. However, the current slow progression of adoption, limiting the generation of healthcare efficiencies through technological innovation, can be realistically overcome by fostering convergence between a systems medicine approach and the principles governing Integrated Care. Implicit with this strategy is the multidisciplinary active collaboration of all stakeholders involved in the change, namely: citizens, professionals with different profiles, academia, policy makers, industry and payers. The article describes the key building blocks of an open and collaborative hub currently being developed in Catalonia (Spain) aiming at generation, deployment and evaluation of a personalized medicine program addressing highly prevalent chronic conditions that often show co-occurrence, namely: cardiovascular disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus; metabolic syndrome and associated mental disturbances (anxiety-depression and altered behavioral patterns leading to unhealthy life styles). © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019."

Collaborative initiatives such as collaborative design, collaborative planning, forecasting and open collective innovations are increasingly accepted as approaches to effectively support decision-making processes in a variety of domains, including, manufacturing, education, healthcare and software industry (Camilleri and Hernández, 2016). Demands and constraints in the supply chain design operations are worthy of attention. The present paper is intended to study the supplier selection problem in a network of suppliers and buyers in the context of a multi-product supply chain. In the beginning, quality measures for supplier selection are collected and categorized into seven areas. Every quality area has been evaluated using the proposed fuzzy variables. In order to rank each product of each supplier in the view of every buyer, fuzzy AHP algorithm was applied. A multi-objective integer programing model was designed to make the whole network beneficial from cost as well as quality metrics. A Genetic Algorithm (3 dimensional) was presented in this study to gain acceptable solution in an advance way. An illustrative example is presented in this paper to transparent the proposed algorithm. © 2018 KIIE"
51,"Objective: Within the information technology (IT) industry, best practices and standards are constantly evolving and being refined. In contrast, computer technology utilized within the healthcare industry often evolves at a glacial pace, with reduced opportunities for justified innovation. Although the use of timely technology refreshes within an enterprise's overall technology stack can be costly, thoughtful adoption of select technologies with a demonstrated return on investment can be very effective in increasing productivity and at the same time, reducing the burden of maintenance often associated with older and legacy systems. In this brief technical communication, we introduce the concept of microservices as applied to the ecosystem of data analysis pipelines. Microservice architecture is a framework for dividing complex systems into easily managed parts. Each individual service is limited in functional scope, thereby conferring a higher measure of functional isolation and reliability to the collective solution. Moreover, maintenance challenges are greatly simplified by virtue of the reduced architectural complexity of each constitutive module. This fact notwithstanding, rendered overall solutions utilizing a microservices-based approach provide equal or greater levels of functionality as compared to conventional programming approaches. Bioinformatics, with its ever-increasing demand for performance and new testing algorithms, is the perfect use-case for such a solution. Moreover, if promulgated within the greater development community as an open-source solution, such an approach holds potential to be transformative to current bioinformatics software development. Context: Bioinformatics relies on nimble IT framework which can adapt to changing requirements. Aims: To present a well-established software design and deployment strategy as a solution for current challenges within bioinformatics Conclusions: Use of the microservices framework is an effective methodology for the fabrication and implementation of reliable and innovative software, made possible in a highly collaborative setting. © 2016 Journal of Pathology Informatics | Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow."
52,"Creativity deals with efficient problem-solving and is deeply rooted in engineering practice and principles, as engineers have faced complex challenges since the dawn of technological development. Creativity promotion techniques have been searched for and generated along the centuries, in parallel with a progressive process of rapprochement to comprehend the basic mechanisms of innovative thinking. The final aim is finding unconventional, effective and efficient solutions to complex problems. In the last decades, the innovation cycle in engineering fields, as connected to the development of processes, products and systems, has been importantly reformulated, in a way reinvented, through the growing internationalization and multidisciplinary ambience in project teams. Furthermore, emergent open-source approaches to technology development, which benefit in many cases from co-creation among global communities interacting online, constitute a relevant driver of change challenging the status quo. All the aforementioned importantly affects the ideation, design, manufacture and use of open-source medical technologies. In consequence, as a support to innovators in the medical field, this chapter describes the innovation cycle, presents some widely accepted creativity promotion techniques and illustrates them by explaining different case studies linked to medical device projects. The potentials of open-source and collaborative strategies for the development of innovative healthcare technologies are also examined and exemplified with selected developments from the UBORA e-infrastructure and community. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."
53,"COVID-19 is an unexpected and brutal pandemic that requires new innovation models to overcome the constraints of this crisis and address its multiple challenges. Open innovation does not replace a traditional closed R&D model; but in the current crisis situation, it can support an ecosystem stakeholders’ effort by leveraging several collaborations. Based on the Tunisian experience, this study illustrates how a crisis can spontaneously create these collaborations between the maker’s community, the users (public healthcare professionals) and key stakeholders (universities, civil society and the private sector among others). To investigate this research question, we adopted a qualitative approach based on a single embedded case study and collected data through participant observation technique. The case study describes a process of crisis-driven innovation based on 3D printing technologies in order to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare professionals. It highlights two distinct phases describing the evolution from a local collaborative model to the creation of a national ecosystem able to design, manufacture and address the growing need of the public healthcare system. Our findings show with empirical evidence the crucial roles played by the makers’ community, FabLabs and engineers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This study draws lessons on how a large health crisis can trigger national crisis-driven innovation (CDI) initiatives, which helped structure the makers’ network and promote collaboration towards a common national goal. A collaborative framework for CDI initiated by the Tunisian makers’ community is proposed in this study and could be adopted in similar crisis contexts, in Global South and North settings. © 2021 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

55,"Quality improvement collaboratives seek to address the mandate to improve healthcare quality and reduce inappropriate variations in care through the use of defined methods and change concepts. There are indications of positive effects, but less evidence of the effectiveness of the methods - the 'black box' of the intervention - and how to effectively implement a collaborative. This study uses an assessment framework to quantify engagement with and uptake of collaborative methodology in 17 projects in a quality improvement collaborative in North West London. The framework developed by the NIHR CLAHRC for Northwest London showed variation in uptake and use of methods within and across projects. For example, most projects involved patients and the public and disseminated learning. There was more limited engagement with the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement Sustainability Model. The framework provides detailed methods-related information that collaborative leaders could use for generative learning to meet participants' needs, and identify peer exemplars. This study raises important questions about implementation fidelity and highlights the need to open the 'black box' both while the work is in progress to allow generative learning, and for the purposes of evaluation. © 2013 MA Healthcare Ltd."
56,"Introduction Healthcare is increasingly challenged to meet the demands of user involvement and knowledge mobilisation required by the 21st-century patient-centred and knowledge-based economies. Innovations are needed to reduce problematic barriers to knowledge exchange and improve collaborative problem solving. Living labs, as open knowledge systems, have the potential to address these gaps but are underexplored in healthcare. Methods and analysis We will conduct the first systematic review of living labs across healthcare contexts. We will comprehensively search the following online databases from inception to 31 December 2020: Scopus, the Cochrane Library (Wiley), Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Web of Science, PsycINFO (OVID) and EBSCOhost databases including Academic Search Complete, Business Source Premier, Canadian Reference Centre, CINAHL, MasterFILE Premier, SPORTDiscus, Library & Information Science Source, Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts, AgeLine, EconLit, Art Full Text, Women's Studies International and Social Work Abstracts. We will search for grey literature using Google advanced techniques and books/book chapters through scholarly and bibliographical databases. We will use a dual-reviewer, two-step selection process with pre-established inclusion criteria and limit to English language publications. Empirical studies of any design examining living lab development, implementation or evaluation in health or healthcare will be included. We will use the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for methodological quality appraisal and Covidence software for review management, and we will extract data on pre-established variables such as lab context and technological platforms. We will create evidence tables and analyse across variables such as focal aim and achievement of living lab principles, such as the use of cocreation and multimethod approaches. We will tabulate data for descriptive reporting and narrative synthesis to identify current applications, approaches and promising areas for living lab development across health contexts. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was not required for this review. This review will inform research into living labs in health environments, including guidance for a living lab in paediatric rehabilitation. Academic publications shared through collaborative networks and social media channels will provide substantive knowledge to the growing tech-health development sector and to researchers, practitioners and organisations seeking enhanced patient/stakeholder engagement and innovations in knowledge translation and evidence-based practice.

57,"EUPATI Belgium (EUPATI.be) is an informal gathering of local partners who are interested in improving patient involvement in healthcare innovation and medicines research and development. EUPATI.be brings together various stakeholders from different areas related to healthcare including patients, academia and industry. In doing so, we create an innovative collaborative approach where actors from different backgrounds work toward improving patient involvement in medical research, and putting the patient at the center of the Belgian healthcare system. Previously, we performed in-depth interviews with a small group of stakeholders on patient involvement. Here, we elaborate on our previous findings by using a nation-wide survey to inquire into Belgian stakeholders' perception on patient involvement. To this end, an electronic survey was available in French, Dutch and English, and accessible for 11 months. Twelve questions were asked, including 11 multiple choice questions and 1 open question. The latter was thematically analyzed according to the framework method. A total of 117 responses were registered and descriptive statistics were performed. The majority of respondents could be categorized into patient, academia and industry, whereas policy makers, payers, and healthcare professionals were underrepresented. We identified several barriers that hamper patient involvement, which were sometimes more reported by specific stakeholder groups. Next, we found that various stakeholders still consider patient involvement as a passive role, i.e., medical subject in a clinical trial. Respondents also reported that the role of the various stakeholders needed more clarification; this was also confirmed by the level of trust amongst the various stakeholders. Existing and the wish for more collaboration with the various stakeholders was reported by almost all respondents. Based on this survey, we can define the potential of involving patients in the medical research and development in the Belgian landscape. Our results will help to understand and tackle the various barriers that currently hamper patient involvement, whilst highlighting the need for a collaborative landscape from the multi-stakeholder perspective. © Copyright © 2020 Grine, Janssens, van Overbeeke, Derijcke, Silva, Delys, Dusart, Aertsen, Mertens de Wilmars, Robaczewska and Stevens."
58,"Innovations in spinal endoscopy technology and technique have broadened their applications during the past 10 years. Smaller outer-diameter working-channel endoscopes have permitted safe usage in the cervical spine for full endoscopic decompressions. Endoscopic fusions have now been widely reported, leveraging compatible instrumentation for disc preparation and expandable interbody grafts. This ultra–minimally invasive technique has also enabled the performance of fusion procedures in awake patients under monitored anesthesia care, affording speedier recovery and treatment options for those unable to undergo general anesthesia. Revision surgery after open or minimally invasive posterior discectomy or instrumentation can now be performed with endoscopic techniques, which often leverage the transforaminal approach to avoid scar tissue and adhesions. These procedures, among other endoscopic surgeries, are now being increasingly performed in ambulatory surgery centers, as safe outcomes, economic benefits to the healthcare system, and patients' desire to recover at home are becoming more apparent. Finally, the standardization of endoscopic terminology, which has long been a confounder to proper communication and education in this field, has recently been addressed by leading experts in a consensus document, which will serve as the foundation for future collaborative advancements. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

61,"The globalisation of healthcare is changing the demands placed on health professionals. It requires different skills and thought processes across national borders. Thinking in an innovative manner may provide healthcare workers with some of the necessary tools to facilitate international change by increasing students’ mental flexibility and ability to apply solutions in multiple contexts. We created the International Innovation Program for health profession education students to learn about and implement the innovation process. The programme provides students the opportunity to learn in interprofessional, international teams and apply didactic knowledge to community problems using the innovation process. The purpose of this article is to describe student perceptions across 4 years of programme implementation. Through analysis of closed-ended survey data, we found that students who participated in the programme reported improvements in collaboration and teamwork, project management, interprofessional teamwork, professional growth and development, thinking in an innovative manner, research and development skills, information seeking, and willingness to work on international projects. Analysis of the open-ended questions revealed five themes: language, teamwork and collaboration, cultural awareness, innovation process, and personal growth and self-improvement. The long-term, follow-up data indicate that these attributes can be transferred into a clinical context which have implications for improved collaboration and patient care. © 2016 Taylor & Francis."
62,"Medical technology has transformed the practice of medicine and patient care, with a wide set of relevant breakthroughs achieved during the last decades. However, in many cases, medical technology is developed in secrecy, and patients’ or medical professionals’ needs are considered as a minor part of the decision-making process, instead of being driven by relevant emergent social needs. In contrast with the biomedical industry, many product fields are now involving stakeholders and future users, since the beginning of the product development process, embracing the new paradigm of “open innovation” and showing interesting results in terms of improved performance, safety, and costs, among others. However, healthcare industry is still reluctant to taking advantage of the enormous potentials of open-source and collaborative approach toward a social development of medical devices. In order to highlight the potentials of open-source and collaborative engineering and design approaches for the future of biomedical industry and to help with its transformation, this chapter is focused on: (1) adequately defining the concept of open-source medical device (OSMD) and its boundaries, (2) presenting pioneering cases of success in the OSMD field and discussing their relevance, and (3) introducing the UBORA e-infrastructure and community, as key initiative in the field.

63,"The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates more than 140 hospitals and 1,000 clinics for the care of America's Military Veterans. VA has made a strategic decision to incorporate an open source software strategy into the modernization plan for its healthcare information system, VistA, as a part of the Open Government Policy. VA established the Open Source Electronic Health Record Alliance (OSEHRA) in 2011 as an independent nonprofit organization outside of government to be a hub for collaboration and rapid innovation. OSEHRA was chartered to build a community that included government as well as members of a global private sector that has developed commercial systems and services incorporating VistA software that has been in the public domain. VA's strategy is a bold attempt to harness the power of community collaboration in support of critical government infrastructure. This paper describes how OSEHRA facilitates transparent interactions between the global private sector and a major federal government agency, while dealing with traditional rules and regulations that often impede open collaboration. It describes several key milestones in the process, including the establishment of an independent certification process for open source code, the community-based collaborative development of a groundbreaking visualization tool to promote community understanding of the system, adoption by VA of major open source code improved and certified by the community, and the first community-wide consensus on code convergence. VA's participation in the code convergence has created the opportunity for a jointly-maintained code base that will benefit not only the U.S. Government, but also healthcare providers around the world. While much work remains in realizing the benefits of this strategy, determined efforts within and outside Government have created a significant opportunity and an informative case study in e-Government. © The Authors, 2016."

65,"Research in technology-enhanced Learning (TEL) is often criticized for not leading to sufficient and sustainable impact in practice. This is especially so for workplace learning technology where learning and the use of technology needs to be embedded in working practices. We report on Learning Layers, a TEL project on workplace learning that ran between 2012 and 2016. We have identified three cases where impact on practice is still visible today, as learning technology originally developed in the project is still in use, impacts learning, teaching and working practices in healthcare practices, construction training and in the application of e-posters in academic conferences. We use the cases to identify factors during the lifetime of the project that have facilitated sustainable take up of research results, namely a flexible and collaborative project roll out, an open research process, early focus on end-users and an inclusive process of planning for impact and exploitation. Taken together, these factors suggest to look at research projects as providing flexible and networked co-creation platforms for innovation. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

66,"Maker culture is on the rise in healthcare with the adoption of consumer-grade fabrication technologies. However, little is known about the activities and resources involved in prototyping medical devices to improve patient care. In this paper, we refer to such activity as medical making to report findings based on a qualitative study of stakeholder engagement in physical prototyping (making) experiences. We examine perspectives from diverse stakeholders including clinicians, engineers, administrators, and medical researchers. Through 18 semi-structured interviews with medical-makers in the US and Canada, we analyze making activity in medical settings. We find that medical makers share strategies to address risks, adopt labor roles, and acquire resources within traditional medical practice. Our findings outline how medical-makers mitigate risks for patient safety, collaborate with local and global stakeholder networks, and overcome constraints of co-location and material practices. We recommend a clinician-aided software system, partially-open repositories, and a collaborative skill-sharing social network to extend their strategies in support of medical making. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."
67,"Background: Awake prone positioning has been reported to improve oxygenation for patients with COVID-19 in retrospective and observational studies, but whether it improves patient-centred outcomes is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of awake prone positioning to prevent intubation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 in a large-scale randomised trial. Methods: In this prospective, a priori set up and defined, collaborative meta-trial of six randomised controlled open-label superiority trials, adults who required respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 were randomly assigned to awake prone positioning or standard care. Hospitals from six countries were involved: Canada, France, Ireland, Mexico, USA, Spain. Patients or their care providers were not masked to allocated treatment. The primary composite outcome was treatment failure, defined as the proportion of patients intubated or dying within 28 days of enrolment. The six trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04325906, NCT04347941, NCT04358939, NCT04395144, NCT04391140, and NCT04477655. Findings: Between April 2, 2020 and Jan 26, 2021, 1126 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to awake prone positioning (n=567) or standard care (n=559). 1121 patients (excluding five who withdrew from the study) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Treatment failure occurred in 223 (40%) of 564 patients assigned to awake prone positioning and in 257 (46%) of 557 patients assigned to standard care (relative risk 0·86 [95% CI 0·75−0·98]). The hazard ratio (HR) for intubation was 0·75 (0·62−0·91), and the HR for mortality was 0·87 (0·68−1·11) with awake prone positioning compared with standard care within 28 days of enrolment. The incidence of prespecified adverse events was low and similar in both groups. Interpretation: Awake prone positioning of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 reduces the incidence of treatment failure and the need for intubation without any signal of harm. These results support routine awake prone positioning of patients with COVID-19 who require support with high-flow nasal cannula.

69,"A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to design medical devices. Scientific and technical knowledge has to address the clinical needs of patients and healthcare providers, and biomedical engineering (BME) education has to promote problem-solving abilities and teamwork.

72,"Even the most innovative healthcare technologies provide patient benefits only when adopted by clinicians and/or patients in actual practice. Yet realizing optimal positive impact from a new technology for the widest range of individuals who would benefit remains elusive. In software and new product development, iterative rapid-cycle 'agile' methods more rapidly provide value, mitigate failure risks, and adapt to customer feedback. Co-development between builders and customers is a key agile principle. But how does one accomplish co-development with busy clinicians? In this paper, we discuss four practical agile co-development practices found helpful clinically: (1) User stories for lightweight requirements; (2) Time-boxed development for collaborative design and prompt course correction; (3) Automated acceptance test driven development, with clinician-vetted specifications; and (4) Monitoring of clinician interactions after release, for rapid-cycle product adaptation and evolution. In the coming wave of innovation in healthcare apps ushered in by open APIs to EHRs, learning rapidly what new product features work well for clinicians and patients will become even more crucial. © 2017 IEEE."
73,"Background: Human morphology is a critical component of dental and medical graduate training. Innovations in basic science teaching methods are needed to keep up with an ever-changing landscape of technology. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether students in a medical and dental histology course would have better grades if they used gaming software Kahoot® and whether gamification effects on learning and enjoyment. Methods: In an effort to both evoke students' interest and expand their skill retention, an online competition using Kahoot® was implemented for first-year students in 2018 (n = 215) at the University of Eastern Finland. Additionally, closed (160/215) or open-ended (41/215) feedback questions were collected and analyzed. Results: The Kahoot® gamification program was successful and resulted in learning gains. The overall participant satisfaction using Kahoot® was high, with students (124/160) indicating that gamification increased their motivation to learn. The gaming approach seemed to enable the students to overcome individual difficulties (139/160) and to set up collaboration (107/160); furthermore, gamification promoted interest (109/160), and the respondents found the immediate feedback from senior professionals to be positive (146/160). In the open-ended survey, the students (23/41) viewed collaborative team- and gamification-based learning positively. Conclusion: This study lends support to the use of gamification in the teaching of histology and may provide a foundation for designing a gamification-integrated curriculum across healthcare disciplines. © 2019 The Author(s)."
74,"The continuous creation and development of new medicinal products not only provide considerable future benefits to human healthcare, but also are critical to the growth and profitability of the biopharmaceutical industry. Among these new products, regenerative medicines (RMs) can potentially address many currently unmet medical needs. The field of RM includes a rapidly expanding set of innovative medical technologies that restore function by allowing the body to repair, replace, and regenerate damaged, ageing or diseased cells, tissues and organs. In spite of this potential, many companies seeking to commercialise RM technologies are struggling to raise the necessary capital. RM companies that wish to prosper in such a resource-constrained environment need to develop new business models and funding strategies. Innovative funding strategies include pursuing alternative sources of funding: (1) governmental and not-for-profit funds; (2) corporate venture funds that pursue strategic returns; (3) partnership deals with pharmaceutical companies; (4) funding through partnerships and mergers; and (5) out-licensing non-core technology or providing consulting or laboratory services. Companies can also follow a capital-efficient business models by focusing and conserving resources with: (1) the extension of technology development in an academic setting; (2) the reduction of the infrastructure and staffing; and (3) the funding of only core projects. Companies can collaborate and leverage shared resources by outsourcing components of their development to expert partners (e.g. CROs, CMOs or Regenerative Medicine Translation Centres) in a possible open innovation environment. Notwithstanding the substantial challenges that the emerging RM companies are currently facing, companies can increase their chances for success by pursuing collaborative, capital-efficient business models and alternate funding strategies. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

75,"The Innovation and Value Initiative started the Open-Source Value Project with the aim to improve the credibility and relevance of model-based value assessment in the context of the US healthcare environment. As a core activity of the Open-Source Value Project, the Innovation and Value Initiative develops and provides access to flexible open-source economic models that are developed iteratively based on public feedback and input. In this article, we describe our experience to date with the development of two currently released, Open-Source Value Project models, one in rheumatoid arthritis and one in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. We developed both Open-Source Value Project models using the statistical programming language R instead of spreadsheet software (i.e., Excel), which allows the models to capture multiple model structures, model sequential treatment with individual patient simulations, and improve integration with formal evidence synthesis. By developing the models in R, we were also able to use version control systems to manage changes to the source code, which is needed for iterative and collaborative model development. Similarly, Open-Source Value Project models are freely available to the public to provide maximum transparency and facilitate collaboration. Development of the rheumatoid arthritis and non-small-cell lung cancer model platforms has presented multiple challenges. The development of multiple components of the model platform tailored to different audiences, including web interfaces, required more resources than a cost-effectiveness analysis for a publication would. Furthermore, we faced methodological hurdles, in particular related to the incorporation of multiple competing model structures and novel elements of value. The iterative development based on public feedback also posed some challenges during the review phase, where methodological experts did not always understand feedback from clinicians and vice versa. Response to the Open-Source Value Project by the modeling community and patient organizations has been positive, but feedback from US decision makers has been limited to date. As we progress with this project, we hope to learn more about the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of an open-source and collaborative approach to model development for value assessment. © 2019, The Author(s)."
76,"Background: Research and development at the edge of micro & nano electronics, nanotechnologies, photonics, materials and biotechnology and their integration into smart miniaturised systems open new opportunities for better quality of life. The area has received substantial public funding and support from the late 90s from the European Union Research Framework Programmes, including the currently running Horizon 2020. We undertook data collection, clustering and analysis of 119 projects (with about 500 M€ EU funding and 890 public and private organisations) covering the area of Micro-Nano-Bio-info technologies and Systems (MNBS) to document the allocation of public money spent on research, development and innovation in this field, to identify synergies, gaps and major trends as well as to verify the alignment with the relevant EU policies and define future challenges and next opportunities for support. Methodology: The projects, funded through several topics of the EC programmes, e.g. Bio-electronics, Biophotonics, Nanomedicine and Healthcare & Well-Being, have been clustered through a semi-automated process based on text mining, using RapidMiner software, with the text describing the projects and their tasks as the input. Text mining-based clustering is grounded in the words contained in the documents provided, and includes basically 2 steps: (i) document pre-processing and (ii) document clustering based on the word frequencies. The hierarchical clustering obtained provide us information related to the proximity of the projects with regard to the meaningful words related to the technologies, processes, applications, etc., which have been kept. This type of grouping provides certainty that projects are grouped with the closest projects in terms of overall content (e.g. objectives, tasks and technologies involved). Results: Classification: Eleven differentiated project categories have been defined, each containing from 6 to 17 projects. These categories can be further re-grouped in broader categories in several ways depending on the purpose, e.g. considering the link to either in-vivo (patient-centred devices) or in-vitro (portable devices and systems and analytical detection platforms) applications, to the level of portability (portable devices vs. platforms), or to the manufacturing importance. Participating (EU and non-EU) organisations include research and academic (37%), private companies (56%), end-users e.g. hospitals or clinical related institutions (4,7%) as well as public authorities and endusers associations in health, food and environment sectors (2,3%). Participation: The participants come from European countries and from Russia, Australia, Japan and the United States. The EU funding is spread all over Europe, though higher concentration is observed in the Western part of Europe. Driving forces: the large majority of projects is driven by two main requirements i.e. avoid the use of specialized laboratory-based (mainly hospital-centred), skilled labour-handled, expensive and time-consuming bio-samples and data analysis; and achieve lower cost, quasi-real-time monitoring or analysis using non-specialized infrastructures, at the Point of Care/Need (out-of-lab). Achievements and Challenges: overall the projects have delivered significant technological progress beyond the state-of-the-art and in some cases integrated prototypes have been validated at the laboratory and in fewer cases tested in real application environments. However, further R&D effort is needed in order to achieve better and compatible interfaces, higher system integration and technology readiness level, better connectivity, efficient manufacturing processes & technologies and validation in real application conditions. Additionally, a critical collaborative effort should be put on effective technology translation of research into new products, speeding up product development, market introduction and cost reduction. This should encompass product design, supply chain setup, user targeting, clinical validation, manufacturing and commercial roll-out. Conclusion: The projects′ portfolio analysis allowed sizing the EU funding and clustering of MNBS research and innovation activities, as well as identifying synergies, major trends, gaps and lessons to be learned for future public investment. Supporting further system integration and validation in real life environments as well as the creation of collaborative interdisciplinary platforms and innovation ecosystems will strongly contribute to new business and markets. It will accelerate the digitization of the European industry in key sectors like healthcare, food and security and support innovation through the full supply chains, thus will positively impact the EU's single market fit for the digital age. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers."
77,"Research on open innovation refers to a model in which innovation is driven by the needs of the customer. In the healthcare sector, healthcare organisations are often the core customers for companies that want to use e-health solutions to improve patient care and cost efficiency. We examined the impact of coupled open innovation on companies' business models. Co-creation between network actors was carried out in a demand-driven manner based on the needs of healthcare professionals. We present the initial findings of a longitudinal case -study in an international setting. The research generated a new, collaborative, open business modelling framework for fact-based value creation that supports companies in the challenging task of exploring economically viable business opportunities. Our paper contributes to the knowledge management and open business model literatures by providing empirical knowledge on the impact of coupled open innovation in the company business models in the knowledge-based economy. © 2020 Journal of Innovation Management.

80,"mHealth4Afrika is a collaborative research and innovation project, co-funded under Horizon 2020, that is evaluating the potential impact of co-designing an open source, multilingual mHealth platform on the quality of maternal and newborn healthcare delivery in rural and deep rural clinics. This paper presents results from a comprehensive baseline study carried out with 40 informants from the leadership of 19 healthcare clinics in Northern Ethiopia, Western Kenya, Southern Malawi and Eastern Cape, South Africa during November - December 2015, using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. These findings identified human resource capacity, environmental, practical and technical challenges, and equipment and infrastructure deficits. Training requirements of healthcare workers were also identified. Constraints identified include the need for: intuitive, easy-to-use user interfaces to reduce the need for extensive training; use of flexible data protocols to facilitate cost effective bandwidth and effective data exchange; cost effective; low power consumption technologies to reduce cost of replication and scaling; solar charging units to increase availability; support for sensors and telemedicine due to a deficit of healthcare professionals in rural and deep rural clinics; and the need for easy configuration and adaptation to facilitate wider adoption. This insight will be used to inform co-design of the mHealth4Afrika platform during 2016-2018, based on user-centered design principles, leveraging current state-of-the-art in terms of electronic patient record systems and medical sensors. It will also inform the minimum ICT infrastructure required in each clinic. The expected outcome is a multi-region proof of concept that can make a significant contribution in accelerating exploitation of mHealth across Africa. © 2016 IEEE."

83,"The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted an international workshop on ultraviolet-C (UV-C) disinfection technologies on January 14-15, 2020, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in collaboration with the International Ultraviolet Association (IUVA). This successful public event, as evidenced by the participation of more than 150 attendees, with 65 % from the ultraviolet technology industry, was part of an ongoing collaborative effort between NIST and the IUVA and its affiliates to examine the measurement and standards needs for pathogen abatement with UV-C in the healthcare whole-room environment. Prior to and since this event, stakeholders from industry, academia, government, and public health services have been collaboratively engaged with NIST to accelerate the development and use of accurate measurements and models for UV-C disinfection technologies and facilitate technology transfer. The workshop served as an open forum to continue this discussion with a technical focus centered on the effective design, use, and implementation of UV-C technologies for the prevention and treatment of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in complex hospital settings. These settings include patient rooms, operating rooms, common staging areas, ventilation systems, personal protective equipment, and tools for the reprocessing and disinfecting of instruments or devices used in medical procedures, such as catheters and ventilators. The critical need for UV-C technologies for disinfection has been amplified by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), stimulating an even greater emphasis on identifying testing and performance metrology needs. This paper discusses these topics based on the international workshop and community activities since the workshop, including a public World-Wide-Web-based seminar with more than 500 registered attendees on September 30, 2020; an international conference on UV-C technologies for air and surface disinfection, December 8-9, 2020; and a webinar on returning to normalcy with the use of UV-C technologies, April 27 and 29, 2021. This article also serves as an introduction to a special section of the Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where full papers address recent technical, noncommercial, UV-C technology and pathogen-abatement investigations. The set of papers provides keen insights from the vantage points of medicine and industry. Recent technical developments, successes, and needs in optics and photonics, radiation physics, biological efficacy, and the needs of future markets in UV-C technologies are described to provide a concise compilation of the community's efforts and the state of the field. Standards needs are identified and discussed throughout this special section. This article provides a summary of the essential role of standards for innovation and implementation of UV-C technology for improved patient care and public health. © 2021 National Institute of Standards and Technology.

86,"The primary aim around developing and optimizing an electronic health record is to improve patient care and population health. The objective of this study is to design and evaluate an action research approach for the optimization of the design of a summary page artefact within an electronic health record for newborn healthcare. An action research approach was chosen for its participatory democratic process for developing practical knowledge and solutions. Collaborative workshops lead by an independent graphic facilitator with a ‘bottom up’ approach, involving self-selected motivated members from multidisciplinary healthcare teams, were designed and conducted. To evaluate this approach, insights were drawn from behavioural and design science paradigms to demonstrate that knowledge and understanding of the design problem and its solution were acquired in building the optimized summary page artefact. Information system development for healthcare requires consideration not just of what we do but how and why we do things. Our analysis demonstrates that action design research represents an agile and lean approach for successful optimization and implementation of information system development in healthcare. © The Author(s) 2020."

88,"Background: Despite recognition of the need to embed patient safety within undergraduate healthcare education, there are limited examples of how this has been achieved within physiotherapy. The purpose of this regional initiative was to develop a course and teaching resources to support Higher Education Institutions in the United Kingdom (UK) when embedding the World Health Organization (WHO) multiprofessional patient safety curriculum into undergraduate healthcare education. Objectives: In this pilot study, researchers assessed the impact of the interprofessional simulation-based education (IPSE) course on students’ perceptions of interprofessional learning and patient safety post-course, and explored the participants’ perceived application of knowledge and skills 3 months later. Methods: A sequential mixed-methods evaluation was conducted, including pre- and post-course Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaires and two course evaluation questionnaires featuring open and closed items (administered immediately post-course and 3 months later). Participants included undergraduate physiotherapy, medical, nursing, and pharmacy students. Results: The IPSE course enabled students to develop an appreciation of each other’s professional roles and particularly their individual and collaborative practices that may positively impact upon patient safety. Post-course students reported being able to influence patient safety through an increased application of their ability to identify errors and influence their colleagues’ practices, thus impacting directly upon patient safety. Conclusion: This paper provides an evaluation of an innovative method of providing interprofessional patient safety learning and teaching opportunities within undergraduate healthcare curricula. © 2013, © W.

90,"Hackathons are leveraged to crowdsource nnovation. Hackathons have become an accepted approach to problem-solving and product development in the technology and healthcare sectors. Hackathons are used by companies, organizations, and research teams either internally or in open formats for different purposes. For AIM, hackathons could serve different purposes for different entities which can range from the discovery/development of new products, identification of innovative approaches, innovative application of existing resources or tools by an organization, and collaborative and inclusive design. Measuring the success will vary and be relative to the set goals of the hackathon, but it is important that organizers come up with open practical questions that can enable them to gauge the effectiveness and usefulness of AIM hackathons. AIM hackathons can be better organized if organizers leverage on existing resources and knowledge, involve more experienced professionals as participants to benefit from their experience and insight, and plan strategically for follow-up to the event for winning teams or solutions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."
91,"Purpose for the Program: Patient safety is in the forefront of education in the healthcare profession. The promotion of open communication and teamwork using obstetric simulation is the purpose of an innovative program introduced to our healthcare system. A new simulation lab was constructed at the College of Nursing within the system. The sister facilities are located within a 30‐mile radius and attempt to attract the same patient population. Proposed Change: An obstetric simulation planning committee was formed to include educators from the three facilities within the healthcare system. The planning committee corresponded via e‐mails and had monthly meetings to share patient safety goals and develop a comprehensive plan for incorporating simulation as an educational component for nurses working in obstetric units. Implementation, Outcomes, and Evaluation: Through scheduled monthly meetings the committee shared numerous ideas to support a fiscally responsible implementation plan. The drills are designed to enhance the learning of the nurse by incorporating the use of psychomotor skills. The nurse also will role‐play and care for a woman through the stages of labor and delivery using the simulator. Responding appropriately to spontaneous obstetric emergencies, including shoulder dystocia and precipitous delivery, are the first areas covered during the implementation of simulation. Implications for Nursing Practice: Meaningful implications for the simulation training include effective communication as an interdisciplinary team; safe collaborative care to the obstetric simulator in the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods; and incorporate the collaboration of facilities to increase competency in varying skill mixes. The labor and delivery staff nurses are required to participate in 4 hours of simulation training annually. The scheduling of nurses from three facilities will allow 16 nurses to participate in training per month. Learning modules on shoulder dystocia and precipitous delivery were constructed to optimize the learning experience for each nurse. The modules contain objectives for each simulation module, pertinent educational materials, and learning assessments. Confidence level scoring will be performed by the nurse to evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation. © 2013 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses"

93,"Building information modeling (BIM) and related digital innovations can serve as a catalyst for more transparency, tighter integration, and increased productivity in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Yet, many project teams struggle with how to work based on the new technology. Collaborative design based on shared information systems like BIM requires changing traditional and institutionalized work practices and routines. A case study of integrated BIM design in a large healthcare construction project serves as an example for how commonly experienced challenges can be overcome. The project has been awarded BuildingSMART's 2015 award for 'outstanding open BIM practice' making it Norway's role model for BIM practice. Based on diffusion of innovations theory, we identified the following set of key factors enabling digital collaboration in this project: change agents, new roles and responsibilities, a cloud computing infrastructure, BIM contracts, and a BIM learning environment. The findings presented in this article may serve as an example for BIM implementation and collaborative work in construction projects. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
94,"The development of medical devices with open source and collaborative design methodologies has the potential to increase the access to medical technologies, thanks to a feasible reduction of design, management, maintenance, and repairing costs linked to the open access of device blueprints. UBORA is an e-infrastructure for the co-design of open source medical devices, which promotes the compliance with internationally recognized quality standards and regulations for safety and efficacy of devices, taking the EN ISO 13485:2016 and the EU MDR 2017/745 as inspiration. UBORA guides the user through a systematic design process, from the identification of clinical needs, of risks class and relevant standards for the device, and provides project management tools, including a repository, finalized to the preparation of the pre-production device dossier. The process is supervised by expert mentors, which ensure that safety and efficacy criteria are fulfilled. The UBORA e-infrastructure is in line with the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals, promoting and strengthening the initiatives of an international community of designers, healthcare providers and policy-makers, toward the reduction of inequalities in the access to medical devices. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
95,"Engineering products benefit from the application of systematic design methodologies during their development processes, as these methodologies help to achieve time- and cost-effective solutions with enhanced functionalities, increased safety and improved reliability. Recent trends, including open innovation, collaborative engineering and the “makers” movement, are reshaping traditional engineering design and opening new horizons in many industrial fields that benefit from user-oriented designs and from creativity promotion through collaboration. The medical field, with the birth of the open-source medical device concept, can greatly benefit from the mentioned trends, although special considerations need to be taken into account. Medical devices are very special products, due to their intimate interaction with the human body and their potential risks. In consequence, even if open innovation and open-source approaches may transform biomedical engineering towards equitable access medical technologies, the transition from classical medical device development towards open-source medical devices should be managed with a focus on safety and regulation compliance. In this chapter, modern methodologies for product development are presented, and key aspects for open-source medical devices are highlighted, with the intention of providing a harmonized methodology for user-centred, safe and regulation-compliant open-source medical technologies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."

98,"Safe performance is essential for any medical technology and its assurance a requirement for reaching market and, hence, making societal impacts. Consequently, a wide set of methodologies, techniques and international standards propose strategies for detecting and minimizing design, manufacturing and operational risks and deal with the analysis and assessment of potential use errors and malfunctions during the operation of healthcare technologies. Open-source medical devices (OSMDs) are typically designed in a collaborative way, involving truly international and multicultural development teams and following development life cycles, through which the information is shared, and also manipulated and updated, within large communities of “makers”. Besides, OSMDs are sometimes manufactured and delivered through still unconventional supply chains. As compared with traditional in-house developments, open-source approaches bring new uncertainties to the process and related potential hazards, if systematic methods for promoting usability and minimizing risks are not adequately shared in the open-source community, applied and documented. At the same time, the openness of information throughout the whole development process should, ideally, promote design peer-review and failure detection at earlier stages, if the design principles for OSMDs and their special features are correctly considered.In consequence, this chapter is prepared with the intention of summarizing the more relevant techniques and standards for usability promotion and risk minimization in biomedical engineering (BME) tasks linked to healthcare technology development. In addition, the final purpose is presenting an innovative and straightforward - user-friendly - methodology for developing intrinsically safe medical technologies, based on internationally accepted techniques and standards, and directly transferable to open-source medical devices. To illustrate the described methods and techniques, several case studies for electromedical devices, invasive devices, standalone software and protecting splints, among others, are presented, which serve to give proof of the flexibility and scalability of this method. Some key aspects linked to applying these methods to projects emerging from open-innovation schemes and delivered as open-source medical devices and technologies are discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."

102,"Purpose: To define organizational culture in hospitals that have received quality certificates and to identify attitudes of healthcare personnel toward change. Methods: The population was all physicians and nurses (N=3,067) employed at four private hospitals that have received accreditation or the ""ISO"" certificate, and four public hospitals, all of which were located within Istanbul city limits. A proportional sample of 570 participants were selected from the eight hospitals. Data-gathering tools were information form, culture scale, and Attitude Against Change Scale (AACS). Data were evaluated by using descriptive statistics, Cronbach alpha coefficient, Chi-square test, and by t test for dependent groups, one-way variance analysis (ANOVA), and Tukey test. Findings: The lowest score averages on the AACS were found in those employed in public hospitals, in those who perceived top executives as autocrats, and in those who were unwilling to participate in quality studies. Participants in a power culture were least open to change. Conclusions: A collaborative culture was the most evident culture in private hospitals, but in public hospitals the most dominant culture was a power culture. © 2007 Sigma Theta Tau International."
103,"Currently, the Academy of Canadian Executive Nurses (ACEN) is working with the Association of Canadian Academic Healthcare Organizations (ACAHO) to develop a joint position paper on patient safety cultures and leadership within Academic Health Science Centres (AHSCs). Pressures to improve patient safety within our healthcare system are gaining momentum daily. Because AHSCs in Canada are the key organizations that are positioned regionally and nationally, where service delivery is the platform for the education of future healthcare providers, and where the development of new knowledge and innovation through research occurs, leadership for patient safety logically must emanate from them. As a primer, ACEN provides an overview of current patient safety initiatives in AHSCs to date. In addition, the following six key areas for action are identified to ensure that AHSCs continue to be leaders in delivering quality, safe healthcare in Canada. These include: (1) strategic orientation to safety culture and quality improvement, (2) open and transparent disclosure policies, (3) health human resources integral to ensuring patient safety practices, (4) effective linkages between AHSCs and academic institutions, (5) national patient safety accountability initiatives and (6) collaborative team practice."

105,"Rising healthcare costs and vast business opportunities in health markets have resulted in a great demand to enhance innovation creation. However, innovation development in healthcare is challenging because of the fragmented and complicated context. Potential means to tackle the challenges include utilising the concepts of open innovation and co-creation, which require organisations to develop new roles and relationships with multiple stakeholders. This paper analyses a 12-month co-creation project where a new collaboration model for healthcare innovations was developed by a hospital, research partners, and companies. We demonstrate how organisations experiment with collaborative innovation in the healthcare context, and what was learned from this experimentation. The study utilises an action research approach and a case study strategy. The co-creation model applied can produce innovations that meet the end-users' needs, but successful implementation requires careful planning, creating separate development paths for idea-type and more mature solutions, and the commitment of project participants."
106,"The vision of this paper is that collaboration creates new openings for engagement of non-commercial actors, such as universities, in innovation networks on the one hand, while opening up for collaborative innovation, and getting valuable real life anchors on the other hand, all these underpinned by greater connectivity and globalization.

107,"The digital footprint marks all parts of society and impacts our lifestyles. Beyond perceived changes in individual way of life, digital revolution also affects sociotechnical systems, collective structures or communities that delivers primary services for citizens. Healthcare is deeply impacted by such a digital mutation at many levels (patient expectations, caregivers practices and organization). We are probably witnessing the emergence of smart and personalized healthcare with a very large scope. To be included in this dynamics, many healthcare organizations now feature collaborative approaches and open innovation management to improve their performance in a sustainable perspective. But the complexity of systems is often a limit to their progress. This paper discuss the place and role that could be played by new utilities that are naturally based on open innovation approach: the living labs. In connected health where many stakeholders should interact, they are naturally expanding. Using an example, we show the gains in value chain that this new envision of open innovation could provide. In parallel, the paper argues for a development of open innovation engineering in such labs. It leads to the conclusion that a reference framework is helpful in such a perspective."
108,"The potential of inclusive medical technological innovations to create access to affordable and appropriate products and services for local healthcare systems in developing countries has emerged as a critical area of academic and policy debates. This research contributes to these debates by studying the key factors, actors and their interactions influencing the development and adoption of three innovative diagnostic devices to resolve the healthcare needs of the local population in the Indian healthcare systems. It highlights the critical role of the state in influencing the development and adoption of inclusive MedTech innovations in resource-constraint settings. It further reveals that the availability of finance facilitated the early-stage development of innovations. At the same time, collaborative arrangements with a diverse set of stakeholders contributed to late-stage development and adoption of innovations in the local healthcare systems. This research also expands on the conceptualization of inclusivity in the MedTech sector by providing a holistic interpretation of affordability as reducing healthcare costs over a longer period through access to early diagnostics rather than the purchase cost of a product. These research findings have significant implications for innovation and healthcare policies that can help to resolve the challenges of accessible healthcare in developing countries."
109,"The potential impact of technology innovation supporting social and economic development in developing countries is very dependent on the level of maturity of National Innovation Ecosystems (including policy environment, infrastructure and socio-economic diversification). Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have recently experienced considerable technological entrepreneurial growth, facilitated by Innovation friendly regulatory environments, evolution of National Research Education Networks (NReNs) and rollout of fibre optic backbones. However, while it is clear that ICT, Job Creation and developing a Knowledge Economy are common policy priorities, the Innovation Ecosystems in Nairobi, Dar es Salaam and Kampala are still fragmented. Innovation Spaces are insufficiently differentiated and have sustainability challenges with their business models and there is a limited funding and entrepreneurship support as well as insufficient collaboration and coordination between Stakeholders. This paper analyses these Innovation Ecosystems and provides some recommendations about how these challenges can be addressed."
110,"For addressing grand challenges, in recent decades, we have seen a growing focus on collaborative innovation in the public sector. However, despite important work, current research is paying relatively little attention to what facets of collaborative innovation are relevant and how they enhance the required innovative performance. To face the grand challenge of public safety, international military organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), need to pursue a collaborative innovation process. In this study, we open up the black box of collaborative innovation by unraveling three critical mechanisms that improve a public organization's innovation performance. Our specific aim was to unfold the ways that Transactive Memory (i.e., knowing who knows what), Knowledge Sharing, and Learning From Failure affect innovation performance. We do this by examining 166 responses from multiple innovation teams at NATO, Ministries of Defense, and Centers of Excellence. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the knowledge coordination aspect of Transactive Memory and learning from others' failures enhance innovation performance. Surprisingly, the effect of knowledge sharing on innovation performance is nonexistent and fully mediated by learning from failure. So, we contribute by unraveling how these three critical mechanisms influence innovation performance in a public organization. Future research could validate our findings in different public sector contexts (e.g., healthcare), focus on transactive memory's role in relation to the two sides of knowledge sharing (sending and receiving), and further examine how knowledge sharing impacts innovation performance in a public military context."
111,"Background: There is a growing expectation that many health organisations will implement innovations. One obstacle for innovative ideas to have an impact on the healthcare system in practice seems to be difficulties in the implementation phase. There is a lack of concretization of theoretical perspectives related to implementation of innovations. The research question answered by this article is: Which enabling factors can facilitate the specific step of moving from idea generation to implementation in a healthcare context? Methods: The research was carried out with a qualitative action research methodology where the researchers took part in the innovation implementation project. The authors of this article were part of a collaborative innovation implementation project involving approximately 54 practitioners. The project was run by five stakeholders: (1) the Division of Assistive Technology in the Dalarna County Council Regional Healthcare Administration, (2) the Habilitation Division, (3) the Division for Home Care and Social Services in the municipality of Leksand, (4) Dalarna University, and (5) Uppsala University. Through a 'Pearl growing' technique six implementation management perspectives were, as a framework, identified and presented for the practitioners. The practitioners worked further to concretize these six perspectives. Data was collected through five workshops and collaborations between the researchers and the practitioners. Data was clustered regarding what the managers want to achieve within these six perspectives (ideal situation) and the main means for reaching this situation. Results: The study underlying this article generated 35 concrete enabling factors for successful innovation implementation, distributed over the initially presented six theoretical perspectives. Conclusion: Concretizing management principles into enabling factors shows, on the one hand, that the theoretical principles have practical value, but on the other that they must be adopted to the specific circumstances of each organization, and that too abstract principles can hardly be operationalized.

112,"Faced with a weak new-product pipeline, functional silos, a hierarchical management style, and an inward-looking mindset, Orion's R&D organization needed to dramatically improve its productivity and adapt to a new R&D paradigm sweeping across the pharmaceutical industry. In response, its R&D management team designed and implemented an organizational transformation process based on proactive culture change. Through incremental initiatives and a comprehensive reorganization, the company built a more open, collaborative, and results-oriented R&D organization able to thrive in the evolving pharmaceutical industry."
113,"Simple Summary The advancement in both science and technology has contributed to the development of novel diagnostic technologies; such technologies enable medical practitioners to diagnose diseases that could not be previously detected. However, in order to translate new technologies into practical applications, various types of challenges need to be overcome. To address these challenges, including those in clinical management and regulatory science, healthcare policies have been constantly implemented to promote the practical application of outcomes generated by healthcare innovation. This study conducted comparative analyses of three tumor profiling tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017, hypothesizing that the FDA's regulatory reforms, early application of new technologies to both research and clinical settings, and open data accumulated as a result of large-scale research programs have promoted new drug development in oncology. The study then discussed the implications potentially suggested by the outcomes and challenges of the three tests. This study investigated a case of Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), a tumor profiling test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017, to examine what factors would contribute to healthcare innovation. First, we set the following three parameters to observe cases: (i) the FDA regulatory reforms, (ii) early application of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), to both research and clinical settings, and (iii) accumulation of open data. Then, we performed a comparative analysis of MSK-IMPACT with FoundationOne CDx and Oncomine Dx Target Test, both of which were FDA-approved tumor profiling tests launched in 2017. As a result, we found that MSK-IMPACT secures neutrality as a non-profit organization, achieves the active incorporation of basic research results, and performs superiorly in clinical operations, such as patient enrollment. On the contrary, we confirmed that FoundationOne CDx was the most prominent case in terms of the number of new drugs and expanded indications approved in which the FDA's expedited approval programs were considerably utilized. Consequently, to uncover the full potential of MSK-IMPACT, it is suggested that more intersectoral collaborative activities between various healthcare stakeholders, in particular, pharmaceutical companies, for driving clinical development must be carried out based on an organizational framework that facilitates collaboration."
114,"The open innovation hub Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform (DHPSP) was recently established with the purpose to invigorate collaborative scientific research and the development of new digital products and personalized solutions aiming to improve human health and patient safety. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a Twitter-based campaign centered on using the hashtag #DHPSP to promote the visibility of the DHPSP initiative. Thus, tweets containing #DHPSP were monitored for five weeks for the period 20.10.2020-24.11.2020 and were analyzed with Symplur Signals (social media analytics tool). In the study period, a total of 11,005 tweets containing #DHPSP were posted by 3020 Twitter users, generating 151,984,378 impressions. Analysis of the healthcare stakeholder-identity of the Twitter users who used #DHPSP revealed that the most of participating user accounts belonged to individuals or doctors, with the top three user locations being the United States (501 users), the United Kingdom (155 users), and India (121 users). Analysis of co-occurring hashtags and the full text of the posted tweets further revealed that the major themes of attention in the #DHPSP Twitter-community were related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), medicine and health, digital health technologies, and science communication in general. Overall, these results indicate that the #DHPSP initiative achieved high visibility and engaged a large body of Twitter users interested in the DHPSP focus area. Moreover, the conducted campaign resulted in an increase of DHPSP member enrollments and website visitors, and new scientific collaborations were formed. Thus, Twitter campaigns centered on a dedicated hashtag prove to be a highly efficient tool for visibility promotion, which could be successfully utilized by healthcare-related open innovation platforms or initiatives."
115,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the enactment of collaborative governance as a policy strategy in healthcare - in particular its effects in coordinating multiple collaborative initiatives dedicated to improve the performance of health organizations. It studies overarching governance mechanisms that serve as platforms at a meta-level between policy and frontline practice. Design/methodology/approach Four collaborative governance arrangements dedicated to improve health outcomes in the Netherlands are analyzed in a comparative case-study design, based on extensive document analysis (n=121) and interviews (n=56) with key stakeholders in the field, including the Dutch Ministry of Health, health organizations and other actors. Findings The studied policy-based governance mechanisms for the coordination of multiple micro-level collaborative initiatives function partly as platforms in bringing actors and resources together successfully. They do so, by fostering evolvability (the capacity to generate diversity in emergent ways) in relation to goal-setting and intermediation between actors. Yet, they marginalize open access to participants through high selectivity and deliberate exclusion strategies for certain actors, contrary to a platform logic of action. Originality/value Responding to recent calls in the literature, this study applies ideas from public administration to the field of health organization and management to avert failures in the translation of policy ambitions into health practice."
116,"Purpose - This paper analyses together information technologies and health, to address the question of how social networks may, with knowledge sharing to patients, doctors, health care stakeholders, provide a new vehicle to build new emerging smart organizations. The purpose of this paper is to explore with a conceptual approach how social media (Facebook) can be used strategically to promote social innovation. The evolution of the Information Technologies opens, today, new organizational scenarios also in the healthcare systems: the virtual revolution announces a new model of society in which healthcare organizations must change radically managerial imperatives, the structures, the processes and organizational cultures; if they want to survive they must be able to penetrate in emotionality of persons (Normann, 2006). The health care organizations, complex adaptive systems, must become open and collaborative systems, capable of developing deep partnerships with patients, their families and the community benefits from offered services, improving thus the effectiveness and efficiency of medical care. To achieve this, it is necessary to create places, especially virtual, where new distinctive knowledge is created, a knowledge that spreads through relational assets that are established between the human components. The communication process, therefore, takes a central role, both in the operator-user relationships and in the operator- operator relationships. Design/methodology/approach - We implement an approach in which patients are active participants in their own care and we develop a model more collaborative and human that challenges dogmas of communication deeply held inside health organizations to create a new value. The research topic is very complex; therefore, the empirical analysis has been a key point to address it. The data were collected through a pilot project at the national level, which involved 1500 people, including doctors, members of different health care organizations, and patients. Originality/value - The pilot project, starting from the existing data in the literature on the use of virtual communication and of social networks in health care organization, brings to light the fact that today health care organizations are using Facebook as a showcase, without exploiting its true potential. The paper identify to what extent Italian hospitals use social media and if the use of social networks such as communication systems in health care organization improves the human relationship and communication between the patient and the health care system. In fact, replacing medical text cryptic with a natural language, enhanced, where possible, by audio or video recordings, it is possible to maintain the specific terminology needed to identify possible pathologies, reducing the ambiguity. Patients and doctors are linked anywhere and anytime. Healthcare organizations that implement communication systems, using Facebook, may benefit from the ability of this to give a voice to patients, to communicate fast, to be near to the patients, to develop a new image of social hospitals that is of smart organizations. Practical implications - This methodology puts in evidence the need to reaffirm and reshape the closeness and distance between healthcare organizations and individuals. Patients today have a digital identity, spend their free time online in social networks, they have energy, enthusiasm and ability to find on-line solutions to their pathologies, they speak the language of the computer, they love the virtual interaction. And it's the same for doctors: a new generation, always on-line (Veen and Vrakking, 2010) who is connected, content-centric, computerized, community oriented. In this scenario hospitals seem to be becoming aware of the benefits social media could offer but they are still rather sceptical about how Facebook can be used. The challenge is due and it must be not only organizational but, above all, cultural (Normann, 1996)."
117,"Purpose - This paper aims to raise the question of how end-user product innovation is developed by exploring the underlying learning mechanisms that drive such idea realization in practice. A trialogical learning perspective from educational science is applied as an analytical approach to enlighten the black box of learning dynamics in user innovation (UI). Design/methodology/approach - The field study of organizational ethnography is based on in situ observations of the testing and development phase of an adapted aid, an electro-mechanical device for completely hands-free dressing/undressing for people with no arm function. Findings - The results suggest that UI materializes through what this researcher conceptualized as circuits of learning around shared objects that are collaboratively mediated and shaped in interplay between three forces identified as user requirements, interdisciplinary co-creation and object transformation. Research limitations/implications - This in-depth study of UI realization has only started to open the research area of such practices. Further advancement is needed on users as inventors and learners. Cross-fertilization with other fields, such as pedagogy, and particularly branches of theory derived from a socio-material stance, seems fruitful. Practical implications - To cultivate UI through  circuits of learning,  users as learners should pay attention to their shifting roles as teachers, co-learners and co-creators in interdisciplinary collaborative practices to enhance efficient work processes. Originality/value - This study shows the relevance of bringing in learning as a crucial underpinning that contributes to enhancing our understanding of how user innovators create new products. The paper contributes to the UI literature by elaborating on the concept of  circuits of learning as a novel framework of learning mechanisms within UI."
118,"The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates more than 140 hospitals and 1,000 clinics for the care of America's Military Veterans. VA has made a strategic decision to incorporate an open source software strategy into the modernization plan for its healthcare information system, VistA, as a part of the Open Government Policy. VA established the Open Source Electronic Health Record Alliance (OSEHRA) in 2011 as an independent nonprofit organization outside of government to be a hub for collaboration and rapid innovation. OSEHRA was chartered to build a community that included government as well as members of a global private sector that has developed commercial systems and services incorporating VistA software that has been in the public domain. VA's strategy is a bold attempt to harness the power of community collaboration in support of critical government infrastructure. This paper describes how OSEHRA facilitates transparent interactions between the global private sector and a major federal government agency, while dealing with traditional rules and regulations that often impede open collaboration. It describes several key milestones in the process, including the establishment of an independent certification process for open source code, the community-based collaborative development of a groundbreaking visualization tool to promote community understanding of the system, adoption by VA of major open source code improved and certified by the community, and the first community-wide consensus on code convergence. VA's participation in the code convergence has created the opportunity for a jointly-maintained code base that will benefit not only the U.S. Government, but also healthcare providers around the world. While much work remains in realizing the benefits of this strategy, determined efforts within and outside Government have created a significant opportunity and an informative case study in e-Government."
119,"The primary aim around developing and optimizing an electronic health record is to improve patient care and population health. The objective of this study is to design and evaluate an action research approach for the optimization of the design of a summary page artefact within an electronic health record for newborn healthcare. An action research approach was chosen for its participatory democratic process for developing practical knowledge and solutions. Collaborative workshops lead by an independent graphic facilitator with a 'bottom up' approach, involving self-selected motivated members from multidisciplinary healthcare teams, were designed and conducted. To evaluate this approach, insights were drawn from behavioural and design science paradigms to demonstrate that knowledge and understanding of the design problem and its solution were acquired in building the optimized summary page artefact. Information system development for healthcare requires consideration not just of what we do but how and why we do things. Our analysis demonstrates that action design research represents an agile and lean approach for successful optimization and implementation of information system development in healthcare."

121,"In today's world, it is anticipated that DTw and IoRT will transform the idea of digital healthcare and advancement of it what was previously unknown. DTw is (physical or virtual) machines or computer-based models capable of mimicking or twinning  the lives of actual entities such as objects, humans, or human-related features. Since the advent of digital and smart healthcare, the world has swiftly integrated several technologies in healthcare to support improved patient service, extend life expectancy, and lower healthcare expenses.DTw and IoRT are promising technologies and great improvements in this field. In recent years, the concepts of IoRT and DTw have captured the interest of the surgical sector. The flawless integration of data between a physical and virtual machine in either direction is the best way to conduct smart surgery. Artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, various kinds of robotic equipment, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are our pillars of completing the task. Using the DTw technological framework and IoRT infrastructure, this review paper proposes a comparative overview of traditional and IoRT collaborated DTwT and executes an adaptive perspective, opportunities, and challenges in the healthcare sector, namely surgical advances. This is an important addition to digital surgeries and to improve healthcare operations. Our literature review has sorted them according to research areas: the technological innovation, the prospective and opportunities we have, problems facing the surgical industry today and in the future, and offers an evaluation of the enabling technologies for the betterment of employing DTw and IoRT for the developing and secure surgical sector for both patients and doctors."
122,"Innovations in spinal endoscopy technology and technique have broadened their applications during the past 10 years. Smaller outer-diameter working-channel endoscopes have permitted safe usage in the cervical spine for full endoscopic decompressions. Endoscopic fusions have now been widely reported, leveraging compatible instrumentation for disc preparation and expandable interbody grafts. This ultraeminimally invasive technique has also enabled the performance of fusion procedures in awake patients under monitored anesthesia care, affording speedier recovery and treatment options for those unable to undergo general anesthesia. Revision surgery after open or minimally invasive posterior discectomy or instrumentation can now be performed with endoscopic techniques, which often leverage the transforaminal approach to avoid scar tissue and adhesions. These procedures, among other endoscopic surgeries, are now being increasingly performed in ambulatory surgery centers, as safe outcomes, economic benefits to the healthcare system, and patients' desire to recover at home are becoming more apparent. Finally, the standardization of endoscopic terminology, which has long been a confounder to proper communication and education in this field, has recently been addressed by leading experts in a consensus document, which will serve as the foundation for future collaborative advancements."
123,"In recent years, the concept of social innovation has been receiving a lot of attention from both social scientists and decisions makers. The most widespread idea among the latter is that it can be a viable alternative for solving social problems, because it seems that they can offer solutions to problems that neither government policy nor the market have been able to solve. Despite this, research on social innovation in academia is still scarce and it largely focusses on the analysis of case studies. Besides having a definition, it is essential to know the factors that brought about its materialization, as well as the process leading to its consolidation and spread. With a view to identifying, making visible and disseminating good practice, and also reflecting on the concept, the project of the social innovation map for the city of Valencia was raised, as a result of the collaboration between the University of Valencia and Las Naves Foundation of Valencia City Council. The city of Valencia is one of the large Spanish cities that has suffered most intensely the effects of the recent economic crisis, due to the immense importance that the real estate sector and lesser technological activities had acquired in previous years. Economic regression has had important social effects, giving rise to an extremely augmented and increasingly polarised urban space. In this context, the aim of the project is to learn about the social innovation initiatives that exist in the city of Valencia, their type and origin, as well as to understand and analyse the specific social scenario in which they are developing. METHODOLOGY Qualitative and quantitative techniques have been applied alongside each other in the study, working mainly on two lines of research. The first focused on analysing the concept of innovation, with the aim of defining common criteria which would allow us to select and characterise the initiatives. The techniques applied to this end have been: (1) documentary research, (2) conducting an online consultative survey of 51 university professionals from different disciplines on the most important aspects of social innovation, and (3) holding a focus group with experts on the matter from both academic and professional spheres. The second line of work consisted in gathering and analysing case studies in the city of Valencia. Given that there was no existing information, local calls for projects were consulted, as well as trawling through social networks, webs and various documentary sources. This initial enquiry enabled us to register a total of 112 initiatives, which, after filtering these, were reduced to 79, classified in seven categories depending on their main objective. Their geographical location in the urban environment allowed us to deduce some important aspects of the environment in which they arose. RESULTS Contributions to the definition and use of the concept Social innovation is a term that has many and varied interpretations. As common aspects, the experts taking part in the focus-group pointed to the following elements: - It is preferable to talk about sociocultural innovation, because there is not a single social process that is not at the same time cultural; if there is no cultural change, there can hardly be any social innovation. - Social innovation requires creativity, which brings with it the following elements: originality, adaptation, a future-oriented approach and the ability to solve social problems. However, the criterion of originality opens up a debate between, on the one hand, opinions based on the definition of social innovation according to Stanford Social Innovation, and on the other, those who support the definition of Maria Elisa Bernal, based on the experiences of UNECLAC. This latter proposes that social innovation involves new ways of doing traditional jobs, and that these jobs must be replicable in different contexts, so that the novelty is not as important as it is for the experts at the University of Stanford. - Another point of agreement is the role of the Administration. Although this acts as a source of different processes for social innovation, there are administrative structures which often inhibit initiatives being taken, and which still continue to promote standardised and unidirectional responses to complex multi-dimensional problems. There is a lack of dialogue, collaboration, synergy and confusion among the different agents promoting Social Innovation. Innovation in the public sphere is too limited to certain environments and restricted by its own economic, organisational and relational structure. Moreover, the results of the surveys of university teachers show us the conceptual differences arising from the various disciplinary perspectives. So while economists and sociologists give great importance to social challenges, geographers, historians and healthcare professionals consider aspects relating to community development important. However, within these two groups there are also differences: On the one hand, while geographers and historians attach no importance to putting the idea into practice, this for doctors is one of the most significant aspects. On the other hand, economists highlight novelty, whilst sociologists do not. Type of initiatives found, geographical location and relations with districts The 79 initiatives identified have been grouped into seven categories organised according to the aim of the innovation in each of them, the category 'Social dynamics and inclusion' being the one that groups the largest number of initiatives (24% of the total), followed by the one called 'Exchange and collaborative economy networks' (19%). In all of them the Third Sector predominates over other organisational forms such as self-organisation and the private and, above all, public sectors. The date initiatives started shows a significant upturn as of 2013, which can be related to the socio-political context at the time. Concerning the factors that propitiated their appearance, the results show that this is closely linked with the socio-demographic, economic and territorial conditions of the environment in which they appear. The innovative initiatives identified are concentrated in three main urban areas: 1) the district of Ciutat Vella and the neighbouring district of El Botanic; 2) Benimaclet, and the neighbouring districts of Algiros and Rascanya, and 3) Els Poblats Maritim. Although it is evident that we find ourselves facing complex social processes in which different variables intervene, and whose interpretation cannot be made except after a detailed qualitative analysis, this location points to the importance of the following variables: a) Firstly, the existence of initiatives seems to be related to the income level of the population. Literature on social innovation considers that this arises as a means of combatting social exclusion and enhancing the quality of life; this would explain the practical absence of these types of projects in districts inhabited by populations with a high income and the absence of conflicts relating to multiculturalism. b) However, the income variable is an insufficient explanation, since the most active hubs of social innovation do not necessarily match with the worst situation. Therefore, a second explanatory variable points to the link with social and citizen movements, in our case with the indignant movement, which had particular impact on the city of Valencia. The date on which they arose indicates this (65% of the ones detected grew up between 2014 and 2016) and their intensity in the districts which presented a larger percentage of votes for parties related to this movement in the 2015 local elections. c) But perhaps the most important variable is the social and associative fabric, the networks and the social capital consolidated over time. Thus, the three main innovation nuclei coincide with areas with a long tradition of formal or informal sociability, important associative hubs, linked to a powerful neighbourhood movement, an exceptionally dense festive framework, and different types of recreational or cultural associations; social networks which have been set up in response to a situation of prolonged marginalization and to territorial and social conflicts that have affected them. CONCLUSIONS The results of the research conducted enables us to conclude that, although there is a coincidence between the various specialists when pointing to the main aspects of social innovation as cultural change, creativity, adaptation, looking to the future and problem-solving ability, there are also marked differences arising from the different level of familiarity with the concept, and diverse disciplinary perspectives. In this respect, a significant point of agreement is the limited role of the Administration which, although it occasionally acts as a source of different social innovation processes, presents administrative structures which inhibit taking initiatives and continue to promote standardized and unidirectional responses to complex and multi-dimensional problems. Moreover, the empirical analysis has enabled us to point to the importance of geographical conditions (socio-demographical, economic and territorial) in the emergence of these initiatives. Among these conditions, the poor socio-economic situation must be highlighted, but also, and decisively, the link to social and citizen movements, and the existence of social networks and the social capital consolidated over time."
124,"Improving the quality of healthcare involves collaboration between many different stakeholders. Collaborative learning theory suggests that teaching different professional groups alongside each other may enable them to develop skills in how to collaborate effectively, but there is little literature on how this works in practice. Further, though it is recognised that patients play a fundamental role in quality improvement, there are few examples of where they learn together with professionals. To contribute to addressing this gap, we review a collaborative fellowship in Northwest London, designed to build capacity to improve healthcare, which enabled patients and professionals to learn together. Using the lens of collaborative learning, we conducted an exploratory study of six cohorts of the year long programme (71 participants). Data were collected using open text responses from an online survey (n=31) and semi-structured interviews (n=34) and analysed using an inductive open coding approach. The collaborative design of the Fellowship, which included bringing multiple perspectives to discussions of real world problems, was valued by participants who reflected on the safe, egalitarian space created by the programme. Participants (healthcare professionals and patients) found this way of learning initially challenging yet ultimately productive. Despite the pedagogical and practical challenges of developing a collaborative programme, this study indicates that opening up previously restricted learning opportunities as widely as possible, to include patients and carers, is an effective mechanism to develop collaborative skills for quality improvement."
125,"Background: Despite recognition of the need to embed patient safety within undergraduate healthcare education, there are limited examples of how this has been achieved within physiotherapy. The purpose of this regional initiative was to develop a course and teaching resources to support Higher Education Institutions in the United Kingdom (UK) when embedding the World Health Organization (WHO) multiprofessional patient safety curriculum into undergraduate healthcare education. Objectives: In this pilot study, researchers assessed the impact of the interprofessional simulation-based education (IPSE) course on students' perceptions of interprofessional learning and patient safety postcourse, and explored the participants' perceived application of knowledge and skills 3 months later. Methods: A sequential mixed-methods evaluation was conducted, including pre-and post-course Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaires and two course evaluation questionnaires featuring open and closed items (administered immediately post-course and 3 months later). Participants included undergraduate physiotherapy, medical, nursing, and pharmacy students. Results: The IPSE course enabled students to develop an appreciation of each other's professional roles and particularly their individual and collaborative practices that may positively impact upon patient safety. Postcourse students reported being able to influence patient safety through an increased application of their ability to identify errors and influence their colleagues' practices, thus impacting directly upon patient safety. Conclusion: This paper provides an evaluation of an innovative method of providing interprofessional patient safety learning and teaching opportunities within undergraduate healthcare curricula."
126,"Objective Primary healthcare (PHC) quality improvement (QI) initiatives are designed to improve patient care and health outcomes. We evaluated the Quality Improvement and Innovation Partnership (QIIP), an Ontario-wide PHC QI program on access to care, diabetes management and colorectal cancer screening. This manuscript highlights the impact of QIIP on diabetes outcomes and associated vascular risk factors. Research design and methods A cluster matched-control, retrospective prechart and postchart audit was conducted. One physician per QIIP-PHC team (N=34) and control (N=34) were recruited for the audit. Eligible charts were reviewed for prespecified type 2 diabetes mellitus clinical process and outcome data at baseline, during (intervention range: 15-17.5 months) and post. Primary outcome measures were the A1c of patients above study target and proportion of patients with an annual foot exam. Secondary outcome measures included glycemic, hypertension and lipid outcomes and management, screening for diabetes-related complications, healthcare utilization, and diabetes counseling, education and self-management goal setting. Results More patients in the QIIP group achieved statistically improved lipid testing, eye examinations, peripheral neuropathy exams, and documented body mass index. No statistical differences in A1c, low-density lipoprotein or systolic/diastolic blood pressure values were noted, with no significant differences in medication prescription, specialist referrals, or chart-reported diabetes counseling, education or self-management goals. Patients of QIIP physicians had significantly more PHC visits. Conclusion The QIIP-learning collaborative program evaluation using stratified random selection of participants and the inclusion of a control group makes this one of the most rigorous and promising efforts to date evaluating the impact of a QI program in PHC. The chart audit component of this evaluation highlighted that while QIIP improved some secondary diabetes measures, no improvements in clinical outcomes were noted. This study highlights the importance of formalized evaluation of QI initiatives to provide an evidence base to inform future program planning and scale-up."

Today social enterprises are operating in a subsistence market place context, characterized by growing competition for donors and grants: formed to address growing multidimensional social problems and insufficient resources, now they bring in the need for collaboration. That is the reason why social alliances were born: they are voluntary collaborations between different actors, emerging as tools for tackling complex, indivisible social problems that single organizations find difficult to cope with alone. From a resource dependence perspective, the resource complementarities between business and social enterprises motivate them to cooperate. An alliance can provide important benefits for an organization lacking certain resources since it links the organization to another with complementary resources. Coherently with the shift toward a more strategic Corporate Social Responsibility approach and the creation of shared value for business and society, profit-nonprofit (P-NP) collaborations are nowadays evolving into more strategic partnerships where the two organizations work together with common goals and a higher level of involvement. This emerging kind of collaboration has been shown to result in higher benefits for both the company and the society: there is in fact empirical evidence showing that a strong commitment toward CSR can push the company to develop innovative products and services with a high social and environmental value. These innovations are named in literature CSR driven innovations and can be defined as new market spaces, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability issues. This paper suggests a specific collaborative educational model, describing how University could play a further role in helping social alliances developing their products since the concept phase, and at the same time in enabling design students to assimilate methods and expertise for facing Social Innovation projects, always keeping a User-Centered approach. The course focussed on the generation of product-system projects to be adopted in the Centro Sebastiano structure for children with Autism provided by the Foundation. The students designed several concepts for brand new products still not in the healthcare market: the whole designing process was documented and supported by a online blog, in a full open source perspective. The whole initiative was called Co. Meta - by merging the concepts of Cooperation and meta - and was also supported by POLISOCIAL, a programme aimed at developing international and local cooperation projects and at increasing the value of research and didactics. The Co. Meta experience was able to trigger a positive knowledge exchange circuit between the Foundation, obtaining its lacking resources, and the University, giving its younger students the chance to face the main challenges and ties of such a specific user-centered approach since their early learning experience, by defining at the same time a brand new sustainable business model able to create new job opportunities and share social value."
128,"mHealth4Afrika has co-designed and validated a standards-based, comprehensive patient-centric health platform for use in resource constrained environments around the world. Suppored by the European Commission under Horizon 2020, mHealth4Afrika was co=designed to be adaptable and extensible, modular and multilingual. mHealth4Afrika integrates Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) functionality with the use of medical sensors and analytical, data visualisation and decision support tools at the point of care. It supports automatic counting of aggregate program indicator data required by Ministries of Health and SMS appointment notifications to encourage attendance at medical appointments. HL7 FHIR integration has also been undertaken to support transfer of vital sign readings from CE approved medical sensors, lab system data exchange, and the ability to import and export individal patient records to support patient mobility. mHealth4Afrika has leveraged a user-centred design and Collaborative Open Innovation based approach, working in partnership with Ministries of Health, District Health Offices, Clinics Managers and healthcare professionals in healthcare facilities in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and South Africa to inform required functionality, workflow and usability requirements. Following three years of co-design, alpha and beta development, the pilot platform was formally validated in real-life environments by 101 healthcare professionals from 13 of the 23 intervention health facilities in Northwest Ethiopia, Western Kenya and Southern Malawi and 28 clinicians from South Africa, between October 2018 and April 2019. The feedback received was very positive."
129,"Building information modeling (BIM) and related digital innovations can serve as a catalyst for more transparency, tighter integration, and increased productivity in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Yet, many project teams struggle with how to work based on the new technology. Collaborative design based on shared information systems like BIM requires changing traditional and institutionalized work practices and routines. A case study of integrated BIM design in a large healthcare construction project serves as an example for how commonly experienced challenges can be overcome. The project has been awarded BuildingSMART's 2015 award for 'outstanding open BIM practice' making it Norway's role model for BIM practice. Based on diffusion of innovations theory, we identified the following set of key factors enabling digital collaboration in this project: change agents, new roles and responsibilities, a cloud computing infrastructure, BIM contracts, and a BIM learning environment. The findings presented in this article may serve as an example for BIM implementation and collaborative work in construction projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
130,"The European Union (EU) initiative on the Digital Transformation of Health and Care (Digicare) aims to provide the conditions necessary for building a secure, flexible, and decentralized digital health infrastructure. Creating a European Health Research and Innovation Cloud (HRIC) within this environment should enable data sharing and analysis for health research across the EU, in compliance with data protection legislation while preserving the full trust of the participants. Such a HRIC should learn from and build on existing data infrastructures, integrate best practices, and focus on the concrete needs of the community in terms of technologies, governance, management, regulation, and ethics requirements. Here, we describe the vision and expected benefits of digital data sharing in health research activities and present a roadmap that fosters the opportunities while answering the challenges of implementing a HRIC. For this, we put forward five specific recommendations and action points to ensure that a European HRIC: i) is built on established standards and guidelines, providing cloud technologies through an open and decentralized infrastructure; ii) is developed and certified to the highest standards of interoperability and data security that can be trusted by all stakeholders; iii) is supported by a robust ethical and legal framework that is compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); iv) establishes a proper environment for the training of new generations of data and medical scientists; and v) stimulates research and innovation in transnational collaborations through public and private initiatives and partnerships funded by the EU through Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe."
131,"Competent educators are needed to ensure that social and healthcare professionals are effective and highly competent. However, there is too little evidence-based knowledge of current and required enhancements of educators' competences in this field. The aim of this study was to describe social and healthcare educators' perceptions of their competence in education. The study had a qualitative design, based on interviews with educators and rooted in critical realism. Forty-eight participants were recruited from seven universities of applied sciences and two vocational colleges in Finland, with the assistance of contact persons nominated by the institutions. The inclusion criterion for participation was employment by an educational institution as a part-time or full-time, social and/or healthcare educator. Data were collected in the period February-April 2018. The participants were interviewed in 16 focus groups with two to five participants per group. The acquired data were subjected to inductive content analysis, which yielded 506 open codes, 48 sub-categories, nine categories and one main category. The educators' competence was defined as a multidimensional construct, including categories of educators' competences in practicing as an educator, subject, ethics, pedagogy, management and organisation, innovation and development, collaboration, handling cultural and linguistic diversity, and continuous professional development. Educators recognised the need for developing competence in innovation to meet rapid changes in a competitive and increasingly global sociopolitical environment. Enhancement of adaptability to rapid changes was recognised as a necessity. The findings have social value in identifying requirements to improve social and healthcare educators' competence by helping educational leadership to improve educational standards, construct a continuous education framework and create national and/or international curricula for teacher education degree programs to enhance the quality of education. We also suggest that educational leadership needs to establish, maintain and strengthen collaborative strategies to provide effective, adaptable support systems, involving educators and students, in their working practices."
132,"The US National Academy of Sciences has called for the development of a Learning Healthcare System in which patients and clinicians work together to choose care, based on best evidence, and to drive discovery as a natural outgrowth of every clinical encounter to ensure innovation, quality and value at the point of care. However, the vision of a Learning Healthcare System has remained largely aspirational. Over the last 13 years, researchers, clinicians and families, with support from our paediatric medical centre, have designed, developed and implemented a network organisational model to achieve the Learning Healthcare System vision. The network framework aligns participants around a common goal of improving health outcomes, transparency of outcome measures and a flexible and adaptive collaborative learning system. Team collaboration is promoted by using standardised processes, protocols and policies, including communication policies, data sharing, privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Learning methods include collaborative quality improvement using a modified Breakthrough Series approach and statistical process control methods. Participants observe their own results and learn from the experience of others. A common repository (a 'commons') is used to share resources that are created by participants. Standardised technology approaches reduce the burden of data entry, facilitate care and result in data useful for research and learning. We describe how this organisational framework has been replicated in four conditions, resulting in substantial improvements in outcomes, at scale across a variety of conditions."
133,"Quality technical education on healthcare technologies is still inaccessible to young adults in low-resource settings due to high costs, low-tech environments, and gaps in learning materials. The online and open-source collaborative Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodology intends to introduce early-career engineers into the development of healthcare technologies by allowing students from all around the world, regardless of background or place of origin, to engage in collaborative design methods, the use of open-source resources and learning experiences from experts in the field. This paper discusses a case study in which the aforementioned methodology was implemented, the COVID-19 Innovation Competition and Design Bootcamp 2020, which brought together 105 participants from 22 countries, mostly in Africa, to conceptualize the design of 10 medical devices in two weeks for an integral management of the COVID-19 pandemic that is applicable to other infectious disease outbreaks. The presented experience demonstrates that highly formative virtual PBL experiences can be carried out, in a cost-effective way and in connection with real societal needs, for which remarkable solutions can be found, by virtue of multidisciplinary and international cooperation. Our findings demonstrate that even if it is difficult to reach the degree of project completion achievable with longer-term and on-site design-build experiences, on-line PBL has been shown to promote students' professional skills in an effective way."
134,"Background Implementing research findings into practice is a complex process that is not well understood. Facilitation has been described as a key component of getting research findings into practice. The literature on facilitation as a practice innovation is growing. This review aimed to identify facilitator roles and to describe characteristics of facilitation that may be associated with successful research use by healthcare professionals. Methods We searched 10 electronic databases up to December 2016 and used predefined criteria to select articles. We included conceptual papers and empirical studies that described facilitator roles, facilitation processes or interventions, and that focused on healthcare professionals and research use. We used content and thematic analysis to summarise data. Rogers' five main attributes of an innovation guided our synthesis of facilitation characteristics. Results Of the 38 488 articles identified from our online and manual search, we included 195 predominantly research studies. We identified nine facilitator roles: opinion leaders, coaches, champions, research facilitators, clinical/practice facilitators, outreach facilitators, linking agents, knowledge brokers and external-internal facilitators. Fifteen facilitation characteristics were associated with research use, which we grouped into five categories using Rogers' innovation attributes: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability. Conclusions We found a diverse and broad literature on the concept of facilitation that can expand our current thinking about facilitation as an innovation and its potential to support an integrated, collaborative approach to improving healthcare delivery."
135,"Introduction Healthcare is increasingly challenged to meet the demands of user involvement and knowledge mobilisation required by the 21st-century patient-centred and knowledge-based economies. Innovations are needed to reduce problematic barriers to knowledge exchange and improve collaborative problem solving. Living labs, as open knowledge systems, have the potential to address these gaps but are underexplored in healthcare. Methods and analysis We will conduct the first systematic review of living labs across healthcare contexts. We will comprehensively search the following online databases from inception to 31 December 2020: Scopus, the Cochrane Library (Wiley), Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Web of Science, PsycINFO (OVID) and EBSCOhost databases including Academic Search Complete, Business Source Premier, Canadian Reference Centre, CINAHL, MasterFILE Premier, SPORTDiscus, Library & Information Science Source, Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts, AgeLine, EconLit, Art Full Text, Women's Studies International and Social Work Abstracts. We will search for grey literature using Google advanced techniques and books/book chapters through scholarly and bibliographical databases. We will use a dual-reviewer, two-step selection process with pre-established inclusion criteria and limit to English language publications. Empirical studies of any design examining living lab development, implementation or evaluation in health or healthcare will be included. We will use the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) for methodological quality appraisal and Covidence software for review management, and we will extract data on pre-established variables such as lab context and technological platforms. We will create evidence tables and analyse across variables such as focal aim and achievement of living lab principles, such as the use of cocreation and multimethod approaches. We will tabulate data for descriptive reporting and narrative synthesis to identify current applications, approaches and promising areas for living lab development across health contexts. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was not required for this review. This review will inform research into living labs in health environments, including guidance for a living lab in paediatric rehabilitation. Academic publications shared through collaborative networks and social media channels will provide substantive knowledge to the growing tech-health development sector and to researchers, practitioners and organisations seeking enhanced patient/stakeholder engagement and innovations in knowledge translation and evidence-based practice.

136,"Open dialog is both a therapeutic approach and a way of organizing the system of mental healthcare that has been evolving in Finland since the 1980s. In Vermont, over the last decade, there has been an organic statewide effort to begin to integrate dialogic principles into the public system of mental healthcare. Because of the organic nature of these initiatives, there have not been coordinated systemic changes to support dialogic practices. To learn what visions participants in dialogically informed practice contexts have for the future as well as what structural innovations would support these visions anticipation dialogs were offered at three dialogically informed community mental health centers and one public psychiatric. The anticipation dialog was developed in Finland during the late 1980s to aid stuck professional and social networks in finding ways to move forward looking back from an imagined positive future. Twenty-seven multidisciplinary staff members and one service recipient participated in the dialogs. The authors conducted a multi-step process of thematic discourse analysis of all 4 anticipation dialogs. Findings underscore dilemmas entailed in growing a dialogic practice system, including the toll systemic uncertainty takes on workers in the system and the simultaneous pull to offer some amount of open-endedness to the system change process in the spirit of inclusiveness, mutual trust, democracy, and reducing hierarchy. Other key findings influencing sustainability of dialogic practices in community mental health include integrating dialogic work into roles rather than adding them to existing responsibilities. Our experiences indicate that anticipation dialogs may be a way of conducting systemic research that contributes to the forward momentum of system innovation. Offering a greater length of time for organizational anticipation dialogs would be valuable, as would centering the voices of clients and their networks."
137,"The healthcare sector has faced increasing pressures to reduce costs and increase healthcare quality in recent years. Thus, managing knowledge in healthcare organizations is critical to achieving low-cost optimization of higher quality services. Also, information technology (IT) plays an essential and crucial role in providing a central database for managing patient data in the healthcare sector. The current study investigates the effects of three aspects of knowledge capabilities (i.e., individual knowledge capabilities, managerial knowledge capabilities, and collaborative organizational capabilities) on information technology governance in healthcare institutions in the Sultanate of Oman. Data were collected using a non-simple random sampling technique by distributing a questionnaire completed by (325) employees working in (13) public hospitals and medical centers in (8) governorates. The collected data were analyzed using AMOS software and structural equation modeling (SEM). This study indicates that individual knowledge capabilities significantly affect only one dimension of IT governance: IT risk management. Moreover, collaborative knowledge capabilities significantly influence all dimensions of IT governance pillars in healthcare institutions, while managerial knowledge capabilities have no significant effect. The study findings can be used to deeply understand the role of knowledge capabilities in sustaining the IT governance application in the health sector context."
138,"Manual patient handling is one of the most significant challenges leading to musculoskeletal burden among healthcare workers. Traditional working techniques could be enhanced by innovations that can be individually adapted to the physical capacity of nurses. We evaluated the use of a robotic system providing physical relief by collaboratively assisting nurses in manual patient handling tasks. By quantifying kinetic and muscle activity data, it was possible to distinguish two kinds of movement patterns. Highly asymmetric postures and movements corresponded to distinct extremes in lower limb and spine muscle activity data. The use of collaborative robotics significantly reduced maximum force exertion in the caregiving process by up to 51%. Lateral flexion and torsion of the trunk were reduced by up to 54% and 87%, respectively, leading to a significant reduction in mean spine muscle activity of up to 55%. These findings indicate the feasibility of collaborative robot-assisted patient handling and emphasize the need for future individual intervention programs to prevent physical burden in care."
139,"The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosted an international workshop on ultraviolet-C (UV-C) disinfection technologies on January 14-15, 2020, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in collaboration with the International Ultraviolet Association (IUVA). This successful public event, as evidenced by the participation of more than 150 attendees, with 65 % from the ultraviolet technology industry, was part of an ongoing collaborative effort between NIST and the IUVA and its affiliates to examine the measurement and standards needs for pathogen abatement with UV-C in the healthcare whole-room environment. Prior to and since this event, stakeholders from industry, academia, government, and public health services have been collaboratively engaged with NIST to accelerate the development and use of accurate measurements and models for UV-C disinfection technologies and facilitate technology transfer. The workshop served as an open forum to continue this discussion with a technical focus centered on the effective design, use, and implementation of UV-C technologies for the prevention and treatment of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in complex hospital settings. These settings include patient rooms, operating rooms, common staging areas, ventilation systems, personal protective equipment, and tools for the reprocessing and disinfecting of instruments or devices used in medical procedures, such as catheters and ventilators. The critical need for UV-C technologies for disinfection has been amplified by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), stimulating an even greater emphasis on identifying testing and performance metrology needs. This paper discusses these topics based on the international workshop and community activities since the workshop, including a public World-Wide-Web-based seminar with more than 500 registered attendees on September 30, 2020; an international conference on UV-C technologies for air and surface disinfection, December 8-9, 2020; and a webinar on returning to normalcy with the use of UV-C technologies, April 27 and 29, 2021. This article also serves as an introduction to a special section of the Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where full papers address recent technical, noncommercial, UV-C technology and pathogen-abatement investigations. The set of papers provides keen insights from the vantage points of medicine and industry. Recent technical developments, successes, and needs in optics and photonics, radiation physics, biological efficacy, and the needs of future markets in UV-C technologies are described to provide a concise compilation of the community's efforts and the state of the field. Standards needs are identified and discussed throughout this special section. This article provides a summary of the essential role of standards for innovation and implementation of UV-C technology for improved patient care and public health."
140,"Objective Kraftens Hus is the first support centre in Sweden designed by and for people affected by cancer, including patients, family, friends, staff members and local community representatives (collectively 'stakeholders'). The purpose of this study was to explore the meaning, role and experiences of Kraftens Hus stakeholders using a patient and public involved methodology. Methods To understand and map the experiences of visitors to Kraftens Hus, we applied concept mapping (CM), a mixed methods approach where data are collected and analysed in four structured steps designed to capture the diverse perspectives of multiple stakeholders. Qualitative interviews with relevant stakeholders supplemented the CM findings. Results The final concept map contained six clusters of ideas. Within the clusters, there was a recurring theme that cancer-affected people value accessible and long-term psychosocial support (PSS). The intended emotional, social and practical needs identified in a previous design process seem to have been addressed and appreciated by Kraftens Hus visitors. Conclusion Kraftens Hus is an example of a new patient-led social innovation based on a life-event perspective and integration of resources from different sectors in society. By focusing on life, not the disease, the care continuum expands, and long-term PSS is provided alongside cancer treatment. The evaluation confirms that PSS should focus on health and well-being in the broadest sense."
141,"The Innovation and Value Initiative started the Open-Source Value Project with the aim to improve the credibility and relevance of model-based value assessment in the context of the US healthcare environment. As a core activity of the Open-Source Value Project, the Innovation and Value Initiative develops and provides access to flexible open-source economic models that are developed iteratively based on public feedback and input. In this article, we describe our experience to date with the development of two currently released, Open-Source Value Project models, one in rheumatoid arthritis and one in epidermal growth factor receptor-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. We developed both Open-Source Value Project models using the statistical programming language R instead of spreadsheet software (i.e., Excel), which allows the models to capture multiple model structures, model sequential treatment with individual patient simulations, and improve integration with formal evidence synthesis. By developing the models in R, we were also able to use version control systems to manage changes to the source code, which is needed for iterative and collaborative model development. Similarly, Open-Source Value Project models are freely available to the public to provide maximum transparency and facilitate collaboration. Development of the rheumatoid arthritis and non-small-cell lung cancer model platforms has presented multiple challenges. The development of multiple components of the model platform tailored to different audiences, including web interfaces, required more resources than a cost-effectiveness analysis for a publication would. Furthermore, we faced methodological hurdles, in particular related to the incorporation of multiple competing model structures and novel elements of value. The iterative development based on public feedback also posed some challenges during the review phase, where methodological experts did not always understand feedback from clinicians and vice versa. Response to the Open-Source Value Project by the modeling community and patient organizations has been positive, but feedback from US decision makers has been limited to date. As we progress with this project, we hope to learn more about the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of an open-source and collaborative approach to model development for value assessment."
142,"Some emerging countries have made significant progress in developing local pharmaceutical and biotechnology but had less success in building medical device industries (MDIs). This paper explores the weak development of local MDIs by analysing the contrasting evolutionary trajectories of Indian healthcare technology sectors. The Indian pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries have emerged as leading global suppliers of generic drugs and vaccines, in marked contrast to the medical devices industry. This paper reveals that existence of a weak collaborative linkage between medical device manufacturers and the Indian health system, which largely lacks a systemic and cross-sectoral linkages, and weak communication between industry and government policy-makers have become a huge barrier to the development of the Indian MDI in the contemporary neo-liberal environment. The weak connection between technology and industrial policy and healthcare policy objectives has severely hampered both development of national technological capabilities and the creation of affordable health care."
143,"Various real-world data (RWD) sources have emerged in China with the intention of generating real-world evidence (RWE) that can be used in clinical and regulatory decision-making. Despite these efforts, significant barriers remain that hinder high-quality healthcare research. A workshop with 30 representatives from healthcare research agencies, technology companies focused on healthcare big data and pharmaceutical companies was held in December 2020 to identify strategies to overcome the barriers associated with the usability and quality of RWD in China. Across all sectors, examples of barriers identified included inconsistencies in terminology and non-standardised coding practices; the absence of longitudinal data; the absence of transparent data processing and validation practices; and the inability to access and share RWD. While cutting-edge technological innovations and data solutions provided powerful tools, the development of collaborative and synergistic research networks across multiple stakeholders is key to generate accessible, high-quality RWD in China. RWD has the potential to provide clinical, regulatory and reimbursement decision-makers with critical insights that can improve healthcare delivery in China. However, barriers to its access, collection and use must be addressed to generate RWE to guide healthcare stakeholders."
144,"EUPATI Belgium (EUPATI.be) is an informal gathering of local partners who are interested in improving patient involvement in healthcare innovation and medicines research and development. EUPATI.be brings together various stakeholders from different areas related to healthcare including patients, academia and industry. In doing so, we create an innovative collaborative approach where actors from different backgrounds work toward improving patient involvement in medical research, and putting the patient at the center of the Belgian healthcare system. Previously, we performed in-depth interviews with a small group of stakeholders on patient involvement. Here, we elaborate on our previous findings by using a nation-wide survey to inquire into Belgian stakeholders' perception on patient involvement. To this end, an electronic survey was available in French, Dutch and English, and accessible for 11 months. Twelve questions were asked, including 11 multiple choice questions and 1 open question. The latter was thematically analyzed according to the framework method. A total of 117 responses were registered and descriptive statistics were performed. The majority of respondents could be categorized into patient, academia and industry, whereas policy makers, payers, and healthcare professionals were underrepresented. We identified several barriers that hamper patient involvement, which were sometimes more reported by specific stakeholder groups. Next, we found that various stakeholders still consider patient involvement as a passive role, i.e., medical subject in a clinical trial. Respondents also reported that the role of the various stakeholders needed more clarification; this was also confirmed by the level of trust amongst the various stakeholders. Existing and the wish for more collaboration with the various stakeholders was reported by almost all respondents. Based on this survey, we can define the potential of involving patients in the medical research and development in the Belgian landscape. Our results will help to understand and tackle the various barriers that currently hamper patient involvement, whilst highlighting the need for a collaborative landscape from the multi-stakeholder perspective."
145,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death, morbidity, and health-care spending. The Halifax, Nova Scotia-based INSPIRED COPD Outreach Program has proved highly beneficial for patients and the health-care system. With direct investment of <$1-million CAD, a pan-Canadian quality improvement collaborative (QIC) supported the spread of INSPIRED to 19 teams in the 10 Canadian provinces contingent upon participation in evaluation. The collaborative evaluation followed a mixed-methods summative approach relying on collated quantitative data, team documents, and surveys sent to core members of the 19 teams. Survey questions included a series of multiple-choice responses, Likert scale ratings, and open-ended questions. The qualitative evaluation entailed key informant interviews and focus groups undertaken between February and April 2016 post-collaborative. Teams reported that the year-long QIC helped bring focus to a needed, though often overlooked area of improvement, facilitating innovation spread. They report examples of new work practices as well as unanticipated cultural change (given the short QIC time frame). Most teams gained new skills in quality improvement (QI) and evidence-based medicine, showing progress in their ability to measure and implement COPD care improvements. Teams felt networking with other teams across the country toward a common solution as well as learning from a team of clinical innovators and evidence-based innovation were critical to their success. Factors affecting sustainability included local leadership support, involvement of frontline clinicians, and sharing milestones to motivate continued QI. The INSPIRED QIC enabled teams across Canada to adapt and implement a new COPD care model for high users of health-care with rapid improvements to work practices, cultural change, and skill sets, and at relatively low cost."
146,"Rare diseases are difficult if not impossible to study outside of population-based registries. Particularly in the context of rare neurodegenerative diseases characterized by case heterogeneity, difficult differential diagnosis by specialists, and small numbers of patients, registries make otherwise unfeasible incidence studies cost-effective and manageable. Building up and maintaining such registries is challenging and requires strong, active, and collaborative networks. Centralization around a leading institution provides structure and consistency, but this single-site storage leads to inefficiency and bottlenecks and is prone to failures, attacks, and manipulation. Furthermore, a substantial amount of trust is required between parties sharing data in a traditional registry. Patients are increasingly reluctant to share data in light of regular news reports about healthcare data breaches. Underfunded rare disease specialized centers are also hesitant to exchange with the leading institution out of fear that the low numbers of patients may seek treatment elsewhere. A lack of electronic health records and information system interoperability in certain settings leads to information silos and only further exacerbate the other issues. Blockchain technology may provide unique, innovative solutions to many of these challenges. Specifically, through digital trust and the use of an immutable distributed ledger, automated data transaction processing, guaranteed integrity, and enhanced security, blockchain technology seems to be perfectly suitable to optimize current population-based rare neurodegenerative disease registry construction and maintenance."
147,"COVID-19 is an unexpected and brutal pandemic that requires new innovation models to overcome the constraints of this crisis and address its multiple challenges. Open innovation does not replace a traditional closed R&D model; but in the current crisis situation, it can support an ecosystem stakeholders' effort by leveraging several collaborations. Based on the Tunisian experience, this study illustrates how a crisis can spontaneously create these collaborations between the maker's community, the users (public healthcare professionals) and key stakeholders (universities, civil society and the private sector among others). To investigate this research question, we adopted a qualitative approach based on a single embedded case study and collected data through participant observation technique. The case study describes a process of crisis-driven innovation based on 3D printing technologies in order to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare professionals. It highlights two distinct phases describing the evolution from a local collaborative model to the creation of a national ecosystem able to design, manufacture and address the growing need of the public healthcare system. Our findings show with empirical evidence the crucial roles played by the makers' community, FabLabs and engineers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This study draws lessons on how a large health crisis can trigger national crisis-driven innovation (CDI) initiatives, which helped structure the makers' network and promote collaboration towards a common national goal. A collaborative framework for CDI initiated by the Tunisian makers' community is proposed in this study and could be adopted in similar crisis contexts, in Global South and North settings."
148,"With the help of telemedicine, healthcare providers can increase patients' access to high-quality services while reducing the medical expenditure, especially for patients in remote areas. Once advanced care is needed, local patients will first be referred to an online health service and then be referred to the offline hospital if the online healthcare fails. In practice, local community hospitals and the advanced tertiary hospitals generally lack financial incentives to exert costly, but non-reimbursable, effort to avoid poor patient outcomes. Therefore, we build a new model to analyze the interaction between these two service providers, promoting them to exert the right effort by designing payment contracts. Our results show that neither fee-for-service nor bundled payment contracts can achieve the social optimum. Tertiary hospitals always exert less effort than the socially-optimal effort while the community hospital may exert less or more effort depending on the online treatment cost. Then, we propose a performance-based bundled payment contract that can coordinate both hospitals' decisions to achieve socially optimal outcomes. Finally, we numerically show the impact of the referral service fee and the online treatment cost on the efficiency of these contracts."
149,"The aim of UK-REACH ( The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers ) is to understand if, how, and why healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK) from ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. In this article, we present findings from the ethical and legal stream of the study, which undertook qualitative research seeking to understand and address legal, ethical, and social acceptability issues around data protection, privacy, and information governance associated with the linkage of HCWs' registration data and healthcare data. We interviewed 22 key opinion leaders in healthcare and health research from across the UK in two-to-one semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were coded using qualitative thematic analysis. Participants told us that a significant aspect of Big Data research in public health is varying drivers of mistrust-of the research itself, research staff and funders, and broader concerns of mistrust within participant communities, particularly in the context of COVID-19 and those situated in more marginalised community settings. However, despite the challenges, participants also identified ways in which legally compliant and ethically informed approaches to research can be crafted to mitigate or overcome mistrust and establish greater confidence in Big Data public health research. Overall, our research indicates that a Big Data Ethics by Design  approach to research in this area can help assure (1) that meaningful community and participant engagement is taking place and that extant challenges are addressed, and (2) that any new challenges or hitherto unknown unknowns can be rapidly and properly considered to ensure potential (but material) harms are identified and minimised where necessary. Our findings indicate such an approach, in turn, will help drive better scientific breakthroughs that translate into medical innovations and effective public health interventions, which benefit the publics studied, including those who are often marginalised in research."
150,"Purpose Technical solutions could facilitate activities and participation in individuals with disabilities. For the development of solutions, hackathons are a method of interdisciplinary collaboration. For hackathon, the definition of pain points that require solutions is crucial. We aimed to determine engineers' preferences and expectations regarding pain point qualities. Methods We used a collaborative approach involving individuals with disability, families, and healthcare professionals to determine pain points for use by engineering students during a disability Hackathon. A pain point bank was built using 3 upstream sources: a survey (350 responses, 20 pain points selected), interviews (8 children, 13 pain points), and a multidisciplinary workshop based on design thinking methods (45 people, 32 pain points). A fourth source was 20 adults with disabilities present during the Hackathon. Engineering students rated pain point qualities from each source in a questionnaire that included closed questions relating to predefined criteria: achievability, specificity, relevance and attractiveness and open questions to collect non-predefined quality criteria. Results Pain points from the workshop were most frequently used (48%); followed by on-site discussions with mentors (43%), the survey (38%), and interviews (31%). On-site discussions received the highest quality ratings followed by the workshop, survey, and interviews. Three quality criteria emerged from the responses to open questions: representative, empathy, and real-need. Conclusions To be actionable by engineers, pain points must relate to real needs, be achievable, specific, relevant and attractive but also representative and arouse empathy. We devised a checklist of qualities along with a toolbox of methods to achieve each."
151,"Objective: Poor communication is cited as a main cause of poor patient outcomes and errors in healthcare, and clear communication can be especially critical during transitions such as discharge. In this project, communication was standardized for clarity, and techniques were implemented to continue care from inpatient, to discharge, across the post-discharge chasm, to hand-off with the primary care provider (PCP). Methods: The interprofessional (IP) quality improvement initiative included: (1) evidence-based teamwork system; (2) in situ simulation; (3) creation of an IP model of care; and (4) innovations in use of telehealth technology to continue care post-discharge. Results: Measures inpatient/parent satisfaction and the attitudes of the care team have improved. Conclusions: Traditional methods of communication and transition do not meet patient or healthcare provider needs. Communication must be standardized to be understandable and be used by the IP team. Care must continue post-discharge by utilizing technology to increase quality and continuity of care. Practice implications: Improving and practicing communication skills may lead to reductions in healthcare errors and readmissions, and may decrease the length of stay and improve satisfaction of care teams.

152,"Background: Emergency department (ED) use is often viewed as an indicator of health system quality. ED use for mental health (MH) reasons is increasing and costly for health systems, patients, and their families. Patients with mental disorders (MD) including substance use disorders (SUD) and suicidal behaviors are high ED users. Improving ED services for these patients and their families, and developing alternatives to ED use are thus key issues. This study aimed to: (1) describe the implementation of three innovative interventions provided by a brief intervention team, crisis center team, and family-peer support team in a Quebec psychiatric ED, including the identification of implementation barriers, and (2) evaluate the impacts of these ED innovations on MH service use and response to needs. Method: Using mixed methods with data triangulation, the implementation and impact of the three above-named ED interventions were studied. Quantitative data were collected from 101 participants (81 patients, 20 family members) using a user questionnaire and patient medical records. Qualitative data were gathered from focus groups (n = 3) with key intervention staff members (n = 14). The user questionnaire also included open-ended questions. Descriptive, comparative and content analyses were produced. Results: Key implementation issues were identified in relation to system, organizational and patient profiles, similar to results identified in most studies in the ED implementation literature aimed at improving responsiveness to patients with MD. Results were encouraging, as the innovations had a significant impact for improved patient MH service use and adequacy of care. Services also seemed adapted to patient profiles. Family members were grateful for the help received in the ED. Conclusions: Before implementing innovations, managers need to recognize the basic issues common to all new healthcare interventions: the need for staff training and strong involvement, particularly among physicians, development of collaborative tools especially in cases of potential cultural clash between staff and organizations, and continuous quality assessment. Future research needs to confirm the pertinence of these interventions, especially use of family-peer support teams in ED, as a highly innovative intervention. Broader ED strategies could also be deployed to improve MH services and decrease ED use for MH reasons."
153,"Objectives: Comorbid major depression is associated with reduced quality of life and greater use of healthcare resources. A recent randomised trial (SMaRT, Symptom Management Research Trials, Oncology-2) found that a collaborative care treatment programme (Depression Care for People with Cancer, DCPC) was highly effective in treating depression in patients with cancer. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DCPC compared with usual care from a health service perspective. Methods: Costs were estimated using UK national unit cost estimates and health outcomes measured using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness of DCPC compared with usual care was calculated and scenario analyses performed to test alternative assumptions on costs and missing data. Uncertainty was characterised using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The probability of DCPC being cost-effective was determined using the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold range of 20,000 pound to 30,000 pound per QALY gained. Results: DCPC cost on average 631 pound more than usual care per patient, and resulted in a mean gain of 0.066 QALYs, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 9549 pound per QALY. The probability of DCPC being cost-effective was 0.9 or greater at cost-effectiveness thresholds above 20,000 pound per QALY for the base case and scenario analyses. Conclusions: Compared with usual care, DCPC is likely to be cost-effective at the current thresholds used by NICE. This study adds to the weight of evidence that collaborative care treatment models are cost-effective for depression, and provides new evidence regarding their use in specialist medical settings.

154,"There is much potential for open and big data to be used for addressing societal challenges of today. This drives a new kind of partnership called data collaborative emphasizing the value of data for public good. Data collaboratives stand for cross-sector partnerships, whereby organizations in the private or public sector disclose their data, as an act of good will, in order to contribute to a societal cause (such as e.g. healthcare, humanitarian, or other policy issues). In this workshop we focus on this emerging topic which so far has deserved little attention in research. In our previous research an initial framework of influential factors for data collaboratives was introduced. The workshop objective is to validate and refine this initial framework by inviting participants to take part in an interactive live polling exercise and assess a number of propositions about influential factors."
155,"Objectives: Many resource-limited countries have adopted and implemented healthcare reform to improve the quality of healthcare, but few have had much impact and strategies in support of these efforts remain limited. We aimed to explore and propose evidence-based strategies to strengthen implementation of healthcare reform in resource-limited settings. Design: Descriptive and exploratory designs in two phases. Phase I involved assessing the effectiveness of the healthcare reform implemented in Ethiopia in the form of business process reengineering, with evidence compiled from healthcare professionals through a self-administered questionnaire; and phase II involved proposing strategies and seeking consensus from experts using Delphi method. Setting: Public hospitals in central Ethiopia. Participants: 406 healthcare professionals and 10 senior health policy experts. Findings: The healthcare reform that we evaluated was able to restructure hospital departments into case teams, with the goal of adopting a 'one-stop shopping' approach. However, shortages of critical infrastructure, furniture and supplies and job dissatisfaction continued to hamper the system. The most important predictors that influenced implementation of the reform were financial resources, top management commitment and support, collaborative working environment and information technology (IT). Five strategies with 14 operational objectives and 67 potential interventions that could strengthen the reform are proposed based on their strategic priority, which are as follows: reinforce patient-centred quality of care services; foster a healthy and respectful workforce environment; efficient and accountable leadership and governance; efficient use of hospital financing and maximise innovations and the use of health technologies. Conclusions: Effective implementation of healthcare reform remained a challenge for governments in resource-limited settings. Resilient operational, clinical and governance functions of health systems, as well as a motivated and committed health workforce, are important to move healthcare reform processes forward. Political commitments at this juncture might be critical though there need to be a clear demarcation between political and technical engagements."
156,"Increased global connectivity has catalyzed technological development in almost all industries, in part through the facilitation of novel collaborative structures. Notably, open innovation and crowd-sourcingof expertise and/or fundinghas tremendous potential to increase the efficiency with which biomedical ecosystems interact to deliver safe, efficacious and affordable therapies to patients. Consequently, such practices offer tremendous potential in advancing development of cellular therapies. In this vein, the CASMI Translational Stem Cell Consortium (CTSCC) was formed to unite global thought-leaders, producing academically rigorous and commercially practicable solutions to a range of challenges in pluripotent stem cell translation. Critically, the CTSCC research agenda is defined through continuous consultation with its international funding and research partners. Herein, initial findings for all research focus areas are presented to inform global product development strategies, and to stimulate continued industry interaction around biomanufacturing, strategic partnerships, standards, regulation and intellectual property and clinical adoption."
157,"Objective The purpose of this study is to examine workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare professionals in a multiethnic area in China, including prevalence, influencing factors, healthcare professionals' response to WPV, expected antiviolence training measures and content, and evaluation of WPV interventions. Design A cross-sectional study. Setting A grade III, class A hospital in the capital of Yunnan Province, which is the province with the most diverse ethnic minority groups in China. Participants In total, 2036 healthcare professionals participated, with a response rate of 83.79%. Results The prevalence of physical and psychological violence was 5.5% and 43.7%, respectively. Healthcare professionals of ethnic minority were more likely to experience psychological violence (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.05). Stratified by gender, male healthcare professionals of ethnic minority suffered from more physical violence (OR=3.31, 95% CI 1.12 to 9.79), while female healthcare professionals suffered from psychological violence (OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36). We also found a unique work situation in China: overtime duty on-call work (18:00-07:00) was a risk factor for psychological violence (OR=1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93). Healthcare professionals of ethnic minority are less likely to order perpetrators to stop or to report to superiors when faced with psychological violence. They are also more interested in receiving training in force skills and self-defence. Both Han and ethnic minority participants considered security measures as the most useful intervention, while changing the time of shift the most useless one. Conclusion Our study comprehensively described WPV towards healthcare professionals in a multiethnic minority area. More research on WPV conducted in multiethnic areas is needed."
158,"This article contributes to the policy dialogue about how to govern healthcare data in the AI era and how to incentivize patients to share their data. Existing approaches to data-sharing restrict the flow of data. Yet, as healthcare AI technologies rely on data in enhancing their scope, such lack of data hinders the creation of future applications and diminishes the need for data to furnish them. We shift attention to a GDPR based policy that does not restrict data flows and argue that the existing experience in monetizing digitalized copyright material such as music can offer a practical and well tested solution.(c) 2022 The Authors.

160,"mHealth4Afrika is a collaborative research and innovation project, co-funded under Horizon 2020. It is focused on supporting Sustainable Development Goal 3 and Horizon 2020 Societal challenges by developing, researching and evaluating the potential impact of co-designing an open source, multilingual enabled mHealth platform to support quality community-based primary maternal healthcare delivery at semi-urban, rural and deep rural clinics, based on end-user requirements in Southern Africa (Malawi, South Africa), East Africa (Kenya) & Horn of Africa (Ethiopia). This paper aims to share the co-design process applied to develop and validate the alpha prototype, and the implications this had on the design of the beta platform. The validation of the alpha prototype was undertaken with 49 participants from 14 healthcare clinics across Northern Ethiopia, Western Kenya, Southern Malawi and Eastern Cape, South Africa during November - December 2016, using a mix of observation and semi-structured interviews. These findings have informed the co-design of the mHealth4Afrika beta platform, which will be installed in participating clinics on a phased basis during Q3 2017. The expected outcome is a multi-region proof of concept that can make a significant contribution in accelerating exploitation of mHealth across Africa."
161,"Background Awake prone positioning has been reported to improve oxygenation for patients with COVID-19 in retrospective and observational studies, but whether it improves patient-centred outcomes is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of awake prone positioning to prevent intubation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 in a large-scale randomised trial. Methods In this prospective, a priori set up and defined, collaborative meta-trial of six randomised controlled open-label superiority trials, adults who required respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 were randomly assigned to awake prone positioning or standard care. Hospitals from six countries were involved: Canada, France, Ireland, Mexico, USA, Spain. Patients or their care providers were not masked to allocated treatment. The primary composite outcome was treatment failure, defined as the proportion of patients intubated or dying within 28 days of enrolment. The six trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04325906, NCT04347941, NCT04358939, NCT04395144, NCT04391140, and NCT04477655. Findings Between April 2, 2020 and Jan 26, 2021, 1126 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to awake prone positioning (n=567) or standard care (n=559). 1121 patients (excluding five who withdrew from the study) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Treatment failure occurred in 223 (40%) of 564 patients assigned to awake prone positioning and in 257 (46%) of 557 patients assigned to standard care (relative risk 0 center dot 86 [95% CI 0 center dot 75-0 center dot 98]). The hazard ratio (HR) for intubation was 0 center dot 75 (0 center dot 62-0 center dot 91), and the HR for mortality was 0 center dot 87 (0 center dot 68-1 center dot 11) with awake prone positioning compared with standard care within 28 days of enrolment. The incidence of prespecified adverse events was low and similar in both groups. Interpretation Awake prone positioning of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 reduces the incidence of treatment failure and the need for intubation without any signal of harm. These results support routine awake prone positioning of patients with COVID-19 who require support with high-flow nasal cannula.

162,"Sustainability science has been gaining traction within academic research and teaching over the past few decades, and it is now entering a phase of greater maturity as a discipline, with links to sectors beyond the academy including energy, finance, advocacy, development, design, construction, agriculture, and healthcare. Concurrently, the growth of the internet has spurred innovation in platform development. This convergence has generated technology-enabled opportunities for training sustainability scholars and practitioners grounded in active learning pedagogies. Case studies are one active learning strategy becoming established within the fields of environment and sustainability. However, the traditional case study form and mode of delivery, which excel at a retroactive analysis of strategic decision-making and outcomes, can create challenges for teaching about issues involving emergent technologies and rapidly changing scientific and social dimensions. This article describes one novel platform, called Gala, for teaching and learning about sustainability science through case studies that address these challenges. Gala closely integrates text and multimedia components, is easily updated, and embraces content consumers as content creators and vice versa. We also report here the results of one pilot study that investigated differences between graduate and undergraduate student interactions with different case components. Results indicate that both groups heavily used the case narrative, but varied in their use of multimedia components. Such insights into patterns of case use are informing decisions about improvements to Gala and directions for future case production, teaching, and assessment, in order to create better tools for teaching and learning about sustainability."
163,"The globalisation of healthcare is changing the demands placed on health professionals. It requires different skills and thought processes across national borders. Thinking in an innovative manner may provide healthcare workers with some of the necessary tools to facilitate international change by increasing students' mental flexibility and ability to apply solutions in multiple contexts. We created the International Innovation Program for health profession education students to learn about and implement the innovation process. The programme provides students the opportunity to learn in interprofessional, international teams and apply didactic knowledge to community problems using the innovation process. The purpose of this article is to describe student perceptions across 4 years of programme implementation. Through analysis of closed-ended survey data, we found that students who participated in the programme reported improvements in collaboration and teamwork, project management, interprofessional teamwork, professional growth and development, thinking in an innovative manner, research and development skills, information seeking, and willingness to work on international projects. Analysis of the open-ended questions revealed five themes: language, teamwork and collaboration, cultural awareness, innovation process, and personal growth and self-improvement. The long-term, follow-up data indicate that these attributes can be transferred into a clinical context which have implications for improved collaboration and patient care."
164,"We present PADE, a visual analytics tool for collaboratively exploring data from patient administrative systems on large touch displays in meeting contexts. Large touch displays are becoming commercially available, but we have limited knowledge about how they might be used in such a context. We designed PADE based on inquiries with healthcare data analysts tasked with understanding expenses in a healthcare system that serve about six million residents. Our goals in designing the system were to enable the analysts to collaboratively construct hypotheses, quickly generate and execute strategies, and support ad hoc discussions and Q&A sessions during meetings. We created a set of interaction techniques that let users create new visualizations and combine parts of existing ones. We illustrate these possibilities through a collaborative analysis scenario. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and limitations of PADE, its interaction techniques, and future work in this direction."
165,"Introduction: There is overwhelming evidence to support the delivery of high-quality health service at a lower cost with the use of advanced technologies. Implementing remote presence technology to expand clinical care has been fraught with barriers that limit interprofessional collaboration and optimal client outcomes. In Canada, government ministries responsible for correctional services, policing, and health are well positioned to link federal, provincial, and regional services to enhance service delivery at the point of care for individuals detained within the justice system. Using remote presence technology to link the detention center with relevant health services such as the emergency room has the potential to open up a new care pathway. Research Question: The key research question was how a new intervention pathway for individuals detained in police service detention centers could be implemented. Research Design: Utilizing an exploratory qualitative research design, interviews were undertaken with 12 police service and six healthcare participants. Data were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Findings: Four main themes emerged and included role conflict, risk management, resource management, and access to services. A number of collaborative learning partnerships were identified by the participants."
166,"mHealth4Afrika is a collaborative research and innovation project, co-funded under Horizon 2020, that is evaluating the potential impact of co-designing an open source, multilingual mHealth platform on the quality of maternal and newborn healthcare delivery in rural and deep rural clinics. This paper presents results from a comprehensive baseline study carried out with 40 informants from the leadership of 19 healthcare clinics in Northern Ethiopia, Western Kenya, Southern Malawi and Eastern Cape, South Africa during November-December 2015, using focus groups and semistructured interviews. These findings identified human resource capacity, environmental, practical and technical challenges, and equipment and infrastructure deficits. Training requirements of healthcare workers were also identified. Constraints identified include the need for: intuitive, easy-to-use user interfaces to reduce the need for extensive training; use of flexible data protocols to facilitate cost effective bandwidth and effective data exchange; cost effective; low power consumption technologies to reduce cost of replication and scaling; solar charging units to increase availability; support for sensors and telemedicine due to a deficit of healthcare professionals in rural and deep rural clinics; and the need for easy configuration and adaptation to facilitate wider adoption. This insight will be used to inform codesign of the mHealth4Afrika platform during 2016-2018, based on user-centered design principles, leveraging current state-ofthe- art in terms of electronic patient record systems and medical sensors. It will also inform the minimum ICT infrastructure required in each clinic. The expected outcome is a multi-region proof of concept that can make a significant contribution in accelerating exploitation of mHealth across Africa."
167,"Due to profound changes occurring in biomedical knowledge and in health systems worldwide, an entirely new health and social care scenario is emerging. Moreover, the enormous technological potential developed over the last years is increasingly influencing life sciences and driving changes toward personalized medicine and value-based healthcare. However, the current slow progression of adoption, limiting the generation of healthcare efficiencies through technological innovation, can be realistically overcome by fostering convergence between a systems medicine approach and the principles governing Integrated Care. Implicit with this strategy is the multidisciplinary active collaboration of all stakeholders involved in the change, namely: citizens, professionals with different profiles, academia, policy makers, industry and payers. The article describes the key building blocks of an open and collaborative hub currently being developed in Catalonia (Spain) aiming at generation, deployment and evaluation of a personalized medicine program addressing highly prevalent chronic conditions that often show co-occurrence, namely: cardiovascular disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus; metabolic syndrome and associated mental disturbances (anxiety-depression and altered behavioral patterns leading to unhealthy life styles)."
168,"In this paper, a privacy-preserving smart IoT-based healthcare big data storage system with self-adaptive access control is proposed. The aim is to ensure the security of patients' healthcare data, realize access control for normal and emergency scenarios, and support smart deduplication to save the storage space in big data storage system. The medical files generated by the healthcare IoT network are encrypted and transferred to the storage system, which can be securely shared among the healthcare staff from different medical domains leveraging a cross-domain access control policy. The traditional access control technology allows the authorized data users to decrypt patient's sensitive medical data, but also hampers the first-aid treatment when the patient's life is threatened because the on site first-aid personnel are not permitted to get patient's historical medical data. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a secure system to devise a novel two-fold access control mechanism, which is self-adaptive for both normal and emergency situations. In normal application, the healthcare staff with proper attribute secret keys can have the data access privilege; in emergency application, patient's historical medical data can be recovered using a password-based break-glass access mechanism. To save the storage overhead in the big data storage system, a secure deduplication method is designed to eliminate the duplicate medical files with identical data, which may be encrypted with different access policies. A highlight of this smart secure deduplication method is that the remaining medical file after the deduplication can be accessed by all the data users authorized by the different original access policies. This smart healthcare big data storage system is formally proved secure, and extensive comparison and simulations demonstrate its efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
169,"When the training data for machine learning are highly personal or sensitive, collaborative approaches can help a collective of stakeholders to train a model together without having to share any data. But there are still risks to the privacy of the data. This Perspective provides an overview of potential attacks on collaborative machine learning and how these threats could be addressed. Despite the rapid increase of data available to train machine-learning algorithms in many domains, several applications suffer from a paucity of representative and diverse data. The medical and financial sectors are, for example, constrained by legal, ethical, regulatory and privacy concerns preventing data sharing between institutions. Collaborative learning systems, such as federated learning, are designed to circumvent such restrictions and provide a privacy-preserving alternative by eschewing data sharing and relying instead on the distributed remote execution of algorithms. However, such systems are susceptible to malicious adversarial interference attempting to undermine their utility or divulge confidential information. Here we present an overview and analysis of current adversarial attacks and their mitigations in the context of collaborative machine learning. We discuss the applicability of attack vectors to specific learning contexts and attempt to formulate a generic foundation for adversarial influence and mitigation mechanisms. We moreover show that a number of context-specific learning conditions are exploited in similar fashion across all settings. Lastly, we provide a focused perspective on open challenges and promising areas of future research in the field."

171,"Three-dimensional files featuring patients' geometry can be obtained through common tools in dental practice, such as an intraoral scanner (IOS) or Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). The use of 3D files in medical education is promoted, but only few methodologies were reported due to the lack of ease to use and accessible protocols for educators. The aim of this work was to present innovative and accessible methodologies to create 3D files in dental education. The first step requires the definition of the educational outcomes and the situations of interest. The second step relies on the use of IOS and CBCT to digitize the content. The last post-treatment steps involve free software for analysis of quality, re-meshing and simplifying the file in accordance with the desired educational activity. Several examples of educational activities using 3D files are illustrated in dental education and discussed. Three-dimensional files open up many accessible applications for a dental educator, but further investigations are required to develop collaborative tools and prevent educational inequalities between establishments."
172,"Objective There is a widely held assumption that engagement by clinicians and healthcare organisations in research improves healthcare performance at various levels, but little direct empirical evidence has previously been collated. The objective of this study was to address the question: Does research engagement (by clinicians and organisations) improve healthcare performance? Methods An hourglass-shaped review was developed, consisting of three stages: (1) a planning and mapping stage; (2) a focused review concentrating on the core question of whether or not research engagement improves healthcare performance; and (3) a wider (but less systematic) review of papers identified during the two earlier stages, focusing on mechanisms. Results Of the 33 papers included in the focused review, 28 identified improvements in health services performance. Seven out of these papers reported some improvement in health outcomes, with others reporting improved processes of care. The wider review demonstrated that mechanisms such as collaborative and action research can encourage some progress along the pathway from research engagement towards improved healthcare performance. Organisations that have deliberately integrated the research function into organisational structures demonstrate how research engagement can, among other factors, contribute to improved healthcare performance. Conclusions Current evidence suggests that there is an association between the engagement of individuals and healthcare organisations in research and improvements in healthcare performance. The mechanisms through which research engagement might improve healthcare performance overlap and rarely act in isolation, and their effectiveness often depends on the context in which they operate."
173,"In countries with a national health service, new telemedicine and telehealth products and services are 'commissioned' according to a fairly rigorous and regulated process, that usually involves pilot studies and the assembly of ` evidence' to show that the innovation offers performance and/or cost advantages. This is problematic for several reasons and means that many innovations are piloted and performance evaluated, but relatively few pass into mainstream adoption. The current relationship between healthcare commissioners and technology developers is adversarial rather than collaborative. Evaluations and regulatory systems place the responsibility with the developer to prove that the solution works - in other words, to refute the assumption that the solution may not be appropriate. Furthermore, with telemedicine innovations the 'user' and the ` customer' is not a single individual or organisation - the healthcare professional, the patient (and perhaps carer, family or friends), as well as the organisation itself are all involved. A conventional evaluation ignores the organisationally disruptive aspect of the technology. A better question than ` does it work?' would be 'how can we use it?' This paper reviews barriers to adoption and considers the particular issues that developers of telemedicine apps need to address. We propose the Stakeholder Empowered Adoption (SEA) Model, as a process that builds stakeholder (staff and patients, managers, technologists) perspectives into the specification and early design stages and uses scenario modelling and simulations to avoid dependence on actual prototypes. The model recognises that the main economic stakeholders (the health organisation commissioning the innovation and the technology provider) need to drive the process, but end users (professionals and patients) are critical to a useful, adoptable end product. Their involvement in the evaluation and adoption process therefore needs to be well managed."
174,"In Veterans Health Administration's (VA) Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) models, primary care providers, care managers, and mental health clinicians collaboratively provide depression care. Primary care patients, however, still lack timely, sufficient access to psychotherapy treatment. Adapting PC-MHI collaborative care to improve uptake of evidence-based computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) may be a potential solution. Understanding primary care-based mental health clinician perspectives is crucial for facilitating adoption of cCBT as part of collaborative depression care. We examined PC-MHI mental health clinicians' perspectives on adapting collaborative care models to support cCBT for VA primary care patients. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with PC-MHI nurse care managers, licensed social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists in one VA health-care system. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using the constant comparative method, and analyzed for overarching themes. Although cCBT awareness and knowledge were not widespread, participants were highly accepting of enhancing PC-MHI models with cCBT for depression treatment. Participants supported cCBT delivery by a PC-MHI care manager or clinician and saw it as an additional tool to engage patients, particularly younger Veterans, in mental health treatment. They commented that current VA PC-MHI models did not facilitate, and had barriers to, use of online and mobile treatments. If effectively implemented, however, respondents thought it had potential to increase the number of patients they could treat. There is widespread interest in modernizing health systems. VA PC-MHI mental health clinicians appear open to adapting collaborative care to increase uptake of cCBT to improve psychotherapy access."
175,"Introduction As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging evidence suggests that individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds may be disproportionately affected. The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH) project has been initiated to generate rapid evidence on whether and why ethnicity affects COVID-19 diagnosis and clinical outcomes in healthcare workers (HCWs) in the UK, through five interlinked work packages/work streams, three of which form the basis of this protocol. The ethico-legal work (Work Package 3) aims to understand and address legal, ethical and acceptability issues around big data research; the HCWs' experiences study (Work Package 4) explores their work and personal experiences, perceptions of risk, support and coping mechanisms; the stakeholder engagement work (Work Package 5) aims to provide feedback and support with the formulation and dissemination of the project recommendations. Methods and analysis Work Package 3 has two different research strands: (A) desk-based doctrinal research; and (B) empirical qualitative research with key opinion leaders. For the empirical research, in-depth interviews will be conducted digitally and recorded with participants' permission. Recordings will be transcribed, coded and analysed using thematic analysis. In Work Package 4, online in-depth interviews and focus groups will be conducted with approximately 150 HCWs, from across the UK, and these will be recorded with participants' consent. The recordings will be transcribed and coded and data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Work Package 5 will achieve its objectives through regular group meetings and in-group discussions. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been received from the London-Brighton & Sussex Research Ethics Committee of the Health Research Authority (Ref No 20/HRA/4718). Results of the study will be published in open-access journals, and disseminated through conference presentations, project website, stakeholder organisations, media and scientific advisory groups."
176,"Even the most innovative healthcare technologies provide patient benefits only when adopted by clinicians and/or patients in actual practice. Yet realizing optimal positive impact from a new technology for the widest range of individuals who would benefit remains elusive. In software and new product development, iterative rapid-cycle agile methods more rapidly provide value, mitigate failure risks, and adapt to customer feedback. Co-development between builders and customers is a key agile principle. But how does one accomplish co-development with busy clinicians? In this paper, we discuss four practical agile co-development practices found helpful clinically: (1) User stories for lightweight requirements; (2) Time-boxed development for collaborative design and prompt course correction; (3) Automated acceptance test driven development, with clinician-vetted specifications; and (4) Monitoring of clinician interactions after release, for rapid cycle product adaptation and evolution. In the coming wave of innovation in healthcare apps ushered in by open APIs to EHRs, learning rapidly what new product features work well for clinicians and patients will become even more crucial."
177,"Purpose: Wait times for the first cardiac rehabilitation (CR) session are inversely related to CR participation rates. We hypothesized that changing from individually scheduled appointments to a group enrollment and open gym format, in which patients were enrolled during group intake sessions and could arrive for subsequent CR sessions any time during open gym periods, would decrease wait times. Methods: A total of 603 patients enrolled in CR at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from July 2012 to December 2014 were included in the study. We evaluated the effect of changing to a group enrollment and open gym format after adjusting for referral diagnosis, insurance status, seasonality, and other factors. We compared outcomes, including exercise capacity and quality of life, between the 2 groups. Results: Patients in the group enrollment and open gym format had significantly lower average wait times than those receiving individual appointments (14.9 vs 19.5 days, P < .001). After multivariable adjustment, the new CR delivery model was associated with a 22% (3.7 days) decrease in average wait times (95% CI, 1.9- 5.6, P < .001). Patients completing CR had equally beneficial changes in 6-minute walk distance and Patient Health Questionnaire scores between the 2 groups, although there was no significant difference in participation rates or the number of sessions attended. Conclusions: Implementation of a group enrollment and open gym format was associated with a significant decrease in wait times for first CR sessions. This CR delivery model may be an option for programs seeking to decrease wait times."
178,"The International Consortium of Vascular Registries (ICVR) has rapidly developed into a global collaborative. Given the importance of vascular devices for public health, this is apriority direction for regulators, manufacturers, payers and patients advocacy groups. It is an innovative effort building on successes achieved in orthopedics and promotes cohesion among international registries. The ICVR will enable acollaboration of stakeholders to create asustainable global system to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new and existing vascular devices and procedures, while promoting innovation and quality improvement."
179,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality and devastated economies globally. Among groups at increased risk are healthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups. Emerging evidence suggests that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. To date, there has been no large-scale analysis of these risks in UK HCWs or ancillary workers in healthcare settings, stratified by ethnicity or occupation, and adjusted for confounders. This paper reports the protocol for a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study of UK HCWs, as part of the UK-REACH programme (The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers). Methods and analysis A baseline questionnaire will be administered to a national cohort of UK HCWs and ancillary workers in healthcare settings, and those registered with UK healthcare regulators, with follow-up questionnaires administered at 4 and 8 months. With consent, questionnaire data will be linked to health records with 25-year follow-up. Univariate associations between ethnicity and clinical COVID-19 outcomes, physical and mental health, and key confounders/explanatory variables will be tested. Multivariable analyses will test for associations between ethnicity and key outcomes adjusted for the confounder/explanatory variables. We will model changes over time by ethnic group, facilitating understanding of absolute and relative risks in different ethnic groups, and generalisability of findings. Ethics and dissemination The study is approved by Health Research Authority (reference 20/HRA/4718), and carries minimal risk. We aim to manage the small risk of participant distress about questions on sensitive topics by clearly participant information that the questionnaire covers sensitive topics and there is no obligation to answer these or any other questions, and by providing support organisation links. Results will be disseminated with reports to Government and papers submitted to pre-print servers and peer reviewed journals."
180,"We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to relevant clinical testing in glaucoma has the potential to enhance the ability to detect glaucoma. This premise was discussed at the recent Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging meeting, The Future of Artificial Intelligence -Enabled Ophthalmic Image Interpretation: Accelerating Innovation and Implementation Pathways, held virtually September 3-4, 2020.The Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging (CCOI) is an independent self-governing consortium of stakeholders with broad international representation from academic institutions, government agencies, and the private sector whose mission is to act as a forum for the purpose of helping speed innovation in healthcare technology. It was 1 of the first 2 such organizations officially designated by the Food and Drug Administration in September 2019 in response to their announcement of the collaborative community program as a strategic priority for 2018-2020. Further information on the CCOI can be found online at their website (https://www.cc-oi.org/about).Artificial intelligence for glaucoma diagnosis would have high utility globally, because access to care is limited in many parts of the world and half of all people with glaucoma are unaware of their illness. The application of AI technology to glaucoma diagnosis has the potential to broadly increase access to care worldwide, in essence flattening the Earth by providing expert-level evaluation to individuals even in the most remote regions of the planet.

181,"England has more than 15 million people and counting with long-term conditions who have the greatest healthcare needs of the population accounting for 50% of all General Practitioner (GP) appointments and 70% of all bed days. Digital technology has the potential to transform care through empowering patients, establishing more robust therapeutic relationships as well as supporting stronger teamworking across boundaries and enabling creation of communities and networks to support patients. There is some hesitancy in National Health Service to adopt digital innovation, but the pandemic has transformed use of remote monitoring in a matter of weeks. The pandemic has highlighted how collaboration and digital technology innovation can radically transform health and care services at pace when people are provided with the space and support to be innovative. Nurse and clinical leaders with digital knowledge are key in engaging nurses who need to be at the heart of technological developments and implementation to make sure changes facilitate, enhance patient care and improve clinical practice. This project aimed to create a forum that offered time, space and opportunities to innovate; share learning; and develop cross boundary relationships for project teams implementing technology-enabled remote monitoring or virtual ward solutions. Florence Nightingale Foundation scholar and NHSX Digital Health team ran the forum using community of practice principles. Qualitative data were used to measure any potential value created. Forum members reported increase in their personal knowledge as they managed to learn from others. An online platform created as an extension to the forum enabled members to continue networking and access resources. The forum provided space for relationships to get stronger. This enabled innovation that changed practice and performance around increased uptake of tech-enabled remote monitoring solutions by patients as well as indirect health outcomes. Further work is required to collate quantitative data to confirm these claims from the forum members."
182,"BackgroundHuman morphology is a critical component of dental and medical graduate training. Innovations in basic science teaching methods are needed to keep up with an ever-changing landscape of technology. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether students in a medical and dental histology course would have better grades if they used gaming software Kahoot (R) and whether gamification effects on learning and enjoyment.MethodsIn an effort to both evoke students' interest and expand their skill retention, an online competition using Kahoot (R) was implemented for first-year students in 2018 (n=215) at the University of Eastern Finland. Additionally, closed (160/215) or open-ended (41/215) feedback questions were collected and analyzed.ResultsThe Kahoot (R) gamification program was successful and resulted in learning gains. The overall participant satisfaction using Kahoot (R) was high, with students (124/160) indicating that gamification increased their motivation to learn. The gaming approach seemed to enable the students to overcome individual difficulties (139/160) and to set up collaboration (107/160); furthermore, gamification promoted interest (109/160), and the respondents found the immediate feedback from senior professionals to be positive (146/160). In the open-ended survey, the students (23/41) viewed collaborative team- and gamification-based learning positively.ConclusionThis study lends support to the use of gamification in the teaching of histology and may provide a foundation for designing a gamification-integrated curriculum across healthcare disciplines."
183,"Background: Primary care is the principal clinical setting for the management of depression. However, significant shortcomings have been detected in its diagnosis and clinical management, as well as in patient outcomes. We developed the INDI collaborative care model to improve the management of depression in primary care. This intervention has been favorably evaluated in terms of clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness in a clinical trial. Our aim is to bring this intervention from the scientific context into clinical practice. Methods: Objective: To test for the feasibility and impact of a strategy for implementing the INDI model for depression in primary care. Design: A quasi-experiment conducted in primary care. Several areas will be established to implement the new program and other, comparable areas will serve as control group. The study constitutes the preliminary phase preceding generalization of the model in the Catalan public healthcare system. Participants: The target population of the intervention are patients with major depression. The implementation strategy will also involve healthcare professionals, primary care centers, as well as management departments and the healthcare organization itself in the geographical areas where the study will be conducted: Camp de Tarragona and Valles Occidental (Catalonia). Intervention: The INDI model is a program for improving the management of depression involving clinical, instructional, and organizational interventions including the participation of nurses as care managers, the efficacy and efficiency of which has been proven in a clinical trial. We will design an active implementation strategy for this model based on the PARIHS (Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) framework. Measures: Qualitative and quantitative measures will be used to evaluate variables related to the successful implementation of the model: acceptability, utility, penetration, sustainability, and clinical impact. Discussion: This project tests the transferability of a healthcare intervention supported by scientific research to clinical practice. If implementation is successful in this experimental phase, we will use the information and experience obtained to propose and plan the generalization of the INDI model for depression in the Catalan healthcare system. We expect the program to benefit patients, the healthcare system, and society."
184,"As a result of China's economic growth, air pollution, including carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, has caused serious health problems and accompanying heavy economic burdens on healthcare. Therefore, the effect of carbon dioxide emission on healthcare expenditure (HCE) has attracted the interest of many researchers, most of which have adopted traditional empirical methods, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) or quantile regression (QR), to analyze the issue. This paper, however, attempts to introduce Bayesian quantile regression (BQR) to discuss the relationship between carbon dioxide emission and HCE, based on the longitudinal data of 30 provinces in China (2005-2016). It was found that carbon dioxide emission is, indeed, an important factor affecting healthcare expenditure in China, although its influence is not as great as the income variable. It was also revealed that the effect of carbon dioxide emission on HCE at a higher quantile was much smaller, which indicates that most people are not paying sufficient attention to the correlation between air pollution and healthcare. This study also proves the applicability of Bayesian quantile regression and its ability to offer more valuable information, as compared to traditional empirical tools, thus expanding and deepening research capabilities on the topic."
185,"Background: The Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) program seeks to conquer well-understood challenges in medical informatics through breakthrough research. Two SHARP centers have found alignment in their methodological needs: (1) members of the National Center for Cognitive Informatics and Decision-making (NCCD) have developed knowledge bases to support problem-oriented summarizations of patient data, and (2) Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technologies (SMART), which is a platform for reusable medical apps that can run on participating platforms connected to various electronic health records (EHR). Combining the work of these two centers will ensure wide dissemination of new methods for synthesized views of patient data. Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is an NIH-funded clinical research data repository platform in use at over 100 sites worldwide. By also working with a co-occurring initiative to SMART-enabling i2b2, we can confidently write one app that can be used extremely broadly. Objective: Our goal was to facilitate development of intuitive, problem-oriented views of the patient record using NCCD knowledge bases that would run in any EHR. To do this, we developed a collaboration between the two SHARPs and an NIH center, i2b2. Methods: First, we implemented collaborative tools to connect researchers at three institutions. Next, we developed a patient summarization app using the SMART platform and a previously validated NCCD problem-medication linkage knowledge base derived from the National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT). Finally, to SMART-enable i2b2, we implemented two new Web service cells that expose the SMART application programming interface (API), and we made changes to the Web interface of i2b2 to host a carousel of SMART apps. Results: We deployed our SMART-based, NDF-RT-derived patient summarization app in this SMART-i2b2 container. It displays a problem-oriented view of medications and presents a line-graph display of laboratory results. Conclusions: This summarization app can be run in any EHR environment that either supports SMART or runs SMART-enabled i2b2. This i2b2 clinical bridge demonstrates a pathway for reusable app development that does not require EHR vendors to immediately adopt the SMART API. Apps can be developed in SMART and run by clinicians in the i2b2 repository, reusing clinical data extracted from EHRs. This may encourage the adoption of SMART by supporting SMART app development until EHRs adopt the platform. It also allows a new variety of clinical SMART apps, fueled by the broad aggregation of data types available in research repositories. The app (including its knowledge base) and SMART-i2b2 are open-source and freely available for download."
186,"This paper presents the Trusted Integrated Knowledge Dataspace (TIKD), a new dataspace, based on linked data technologies and trusted data sharing, that supports integrated knowledge graphs for sensitive application environments such as healthcare. State-of-the-art shared dataspaces do not consider sensitive data and privacy-aware log records as part of their solutions, defining only how to access data. TIKD complements dataspace security approaches through trusted data sharing that considers personal data handling, data privileges, pseudonymization of user activity logging, and privacy-aware data interlinking services. TIKD was implemented on the Access Risk Knowledge (ARK) Platform, a socio-technical risk governance system, and deployed as part of the ARK-Virus Project which aims to govern the risk management of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) across a group of collaborating healthcare institutions. The ARK Platform was evaluated, both before and after implementing the TIKD, using the ISO 27001 Gap Analysis Tool (GAT) which determines compliance with the information security standard. The results of the evaluation indicated that compliance with ISO 27001 increased from 50% to 85%. The evaluation also provided a set of recommended actions to meet the remaining requirements of the ISO 27001 standard. TIKD provides a collaborative environment, based on knowledge graph integration and GDPR-compliant personal data handling, as part of the data security infrastructure. As a result of this work, a new trusted data security methodology, based on personal data handling, data privileges, access control context specification, and privacy-aware data interlinking, was developed using a knowledge graph approach."
187,"Introduction COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality. People from ethnic minorities, particularly those working in healthcare settings, have been disproportionately affected. Current evidence of the association between ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes in people working in healthcare settings is insufficient to inform plans to address health inequalities. Methods and analysis This study combines anonymised human resource databases with professional registration and National Health Service data sets to assess associations between ethnicity and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and death in healthcare workers in the UK. Adverse COVID-19 outcomes will be assessed between 1 February 2020 (date following first confirmed COVID-19 case in UK) and study end date (31 January 2021), allowing 1-year of follow-up. Planned analyses include multivariable Poisson, logistic and flexible parametric time-to-event regression within each country, adjusting for core predictors, followed by meta-analysis of country-specific results to produce combined effect estimates for the UK. Mediation analysis methods will be explored to examine the direct, indirect and mediated interactive effects between ethnicity, occupational group and COVID-19 outcomes. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for the UK-REACH programme has been obtained via the expedited HRA COVID-19 processes (REC ref: 20/HRA/4718, IRAS ID: 288316). Research information will be anonymised via the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank before release to researchers. Study results will be submitted for publication in an open access peer-reviewed journal and made available on our dedicated website (https://uk-reach.org/)."
188,"Introduction Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a life-threatening chronic disease characterised by periodic exacerbations and recurrent hospitalisations. In the management of CHF, patient compliance with evidence-based clinical guidelines is essential, but remains difficult practically. The objective of this study is to examine whether an Innovative Telemonitoring Enhanced Care Programme for CHF (ITEC-CHF) improves patients' compliance, and associated health and economic outcomes. Methods and analysis An open multicentre randomised controlled trial has been designed. Patients will be recruited and randomised to receive either ITEC-CHF (n=150) or usual care CHF (n=150) for at least 6 months. ITEC-CHF combines usual care and an additional telemonitoring service including remote weight monitoring, structured telephone support and nurse-led collaborative care. The primary outcomes are the compliance rates with the best-practice guidelines for daily weight monitoring. The secondary outcomes include the compliance with other guideline recommendations (health maintenance, medication, diet and exercise), health (health-related quality of life, risk factors, functional capacity and psychological states) and economic outcomes related to the use of healthcare resources such as hospital readmissions and general practitioner/emergency department visits. Ethics and dissemination The clinical trial has been approved by Peninsula Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC Reference: HREC/14/PH/27), Royal Perth Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference: 15-081) and the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference: HR 181/2014). We will disseminate the final results to the public via conferences and journal publications. A final study report will also be provided to the ethics committees."
189,"ObjectiveThe nature of model-based cost-effectiveness analysis can lead to disputes in the scientific community. We propose an iterative and collaborative approach to model development by presenting a flexible open-source simulation model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), accessible to both technical and non-technical end-users.MethodsThe RA model is a discrete-time individual patient simulation with 6-month cycles. Model input parameters were estimated based on currently available evidence and treatment effects were obtained with Bayesian network meta-analysis techniques. The model contains 384 possible model structures informed by previously published models. The model consists of the following components: (i) modifiable R and C++ source code available in a GitHub repository; (ii) an R package to run the model for custom analyses; (iii) detailed model documentation; (iv) a web-based user interface for full control over the model without the need to be well-versed in the programming languages; and (v) a general audience web-application allowing those who are not experts in modeling or health economics to interact with the model and contribute to value assessment discussions.ResultsA primary function of the initial version of RA model is to help understand and quantify the impact of parameter uncertainty (with probabilistic sensitivity analysis), structural uncertainty (with multiple competing model structures), the decision framework (cost-effectiveness analysis or multi-criteria decision analysis), and perspective (healthcare or limited societal) on estimates of value.ConclusionIn order for a decision model to remain relevant over time it needs to evolve along with its supporting body of clinical evidence and scientific insight. Multiple clinical and methodological experts can modify or contribute to the RA model at any time due to its open-source nature."
190,"Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a multicenter intervention to reduce potentially inappropriate antipsychotic use in Canadian nursing homes at the individual and facility levels. Design: Longitudinal, population-based cohort study to evaluate the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement's Spreading Healthcare Innovations Initiative to reduce potentially inappropriate antipsychotic use in 6 provinces/territories. Setting and Participants: Adults in nursing homes in 6 provinces/territories in Canada between 2014 and 2016. The sample involved 4927 residents in 45 intervention homes and 122,570 residents in 1193 control homes in the first quarter of the study. Measures: Assessment data based on the Resident Assessment Instrument 2.0 were used in both settings to track antipsychotic use and to obtain risk-adjusters for a quality indicator on potentially inappropriate use. Intervention: Quality improvement teams in participating organizations were provided with education, training, and support to implement localized strategies intended to reduce antipsychotic medication use in residents without diagnosis of psychosis. Results: At the resident level, we found that the odds of remaining on potentially inappropriate antipsychotics were 0.75 in intervention compared with control homes after adjusting for age, sex, aggressive behavior, and cognition. These findings were evident within the pooled Canadian data as well as within provinces. At the facility level, the intervention homes had greater improvements in risk-adjusted quality indicator performance than the control homes, and this was true for the worst, median, and best-performing homes at baseline. There was no major change in the quality indicator for worsening of behavior symptoms. Conclusions/Implications: The Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement intervention was associated with a reduction in potentially inappropriate antipsychotic use at both the individual and facility levels of analysis. This improvement in performance was independent of secular trends toward reduced antipsychotic use in participating provinces. This suggests that substantial improvements in medication use may be achieved through targeted, collaborative quality improvement initiatives in long-term care. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

191,"Biomedical engineering (BME) has the potential of transforming medical care towards universal healthcare by means of the democratization of medical technology. To this end, innovative holistic approaches and multidisciplinary teams, built upon the gathering of international talent, should be encouraged within the medical industry. However, these transformations can only be accomplished if BME education also continuously evolves and focuses on the internationalization of students, the promotion of collaborative design strategies and the orientation towards context relevant medical needs. In this study we describe an international teaching-learning experience, the UBORA (Swahili for 'excellence') Design School. During an intensive week of training and collaboration 39 engineering students lived through the complete development process for creating innovative open-source medical devices following the CDIO (conceivedesign-implement-operate) approach and using the UBORA e-infrastructure as a co-design platform. Our post-school survey and analyses showed that this integral teaching-learning experience helped to promote professional skills and could nurture the future generation of biomedical engineers, who could transform healthcare technology through collaborative design oriented to open source medical devices."
192,"Background: Today, telehealth is experiencing exponential growth in utilization. Paralleling this trend is the growth in the telehealth industry, with sharp increases in the number of platforms, functionalities, and levels of integrations within both the electronic health record and other technical systems supporting health care. When a telehealth network is intended to be used across independent health care systems, an additional layer of complexity emerges. In the context of regionalized telehealth networks that are not within the same health care system, not only are technical interoperability challenges a practical barrier, but administrative, clinical, and competitive elements also quickly emerge, resulting in fragmented, siloed technologies. Objective: The study aimed to describe a statewide approach to deploying an interoperable open access telehealth network across multiple health systems. Methods: One promising solution to the abovementioned concerns is an open access telehealth network. In the field of telehealth, an open access network (OAN) can be defined as a network infrastructure that can be used by health care providers without a closed or proprietary platform, specific obligatory network, or service-specific telehealth technologies. This framework for the development of an OAN is grounded in practical examples of clinical programs that function in each stage of network maturity based on the experience of the South Carolina Telehealth Alliance (SCTA). The SCTA's experience details successes and challenges in an ongoing effort to achieve an OAN. The model describes an OAN in stages of collaborative maturity and provides insights into the technological, clinical, and administrative implications of making the collaboration possible. Results: The four stages of an OAN are defined according to operational maturity, ranging from feasibility to demonstration of implementation. Each stage is associated with infrastructure and resource requirements and technical and clinical activities. In stage 1, technical standards are agreed upon, and the clinical programs are designed to utilize compliant technologies. In stage 2, collaboration is demonstrated through technical teams working together to address barriers, whereas clinical and administrative teams share best practices. In stage 3, a functional interoperable network is demonstrated with different institutions providing service through common telehealth end points at different patient care sites. In stage 4, clinical workflows are streamlined and standardized across institutions, and economies of scale are achieved through technical and administrative innovations. Conclusions: The approach to OAN development described provides a roadmap for achieving a functional telehealth network across independent health systems. The South Carolina experience reveals both successes and challenges in achieving this goal. The next steps toward the development of OANs include advocacy and ongoing engagement with the developers of telehealth technologies regarding their commitment to interoperability."
193,"Introduction: Social networks applied through Web 2.0 tools have gained importance in health domain, because they produce improvements on the communication and coordination capabilities among health professionals. This is highly relevant for multimorbidity patients care because there is a large number of health professionals in charge of patient care, and this requires to obtain clinical consensus in their decisions. Our objective is to develop a tool for collaborative work among health professionals for multimorbidity patient care. We describe the architecture to incorporate decision support functionalities in a social network tool to enable the adoption of shared decisions among health professionals from different care levels. As part of the first stage of the project, this paper describes the results obtained in a pilot study about acceptance and use of the social network component in our healthcare setting. Methods: At Virgen del Rocio University Hospital we have designed and developed the Shared Care Platform (SCP) to provide support in the continuity of care for multimorbidity patients. The SCP has two consecutively developed components: social network component, called Clinical Wall, and Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. The Clinical Wall contains a record where health professionals are able to debate and define shared decisions. We conducted a pilot study to assess the use and acceptance of the SCP by healthcare professionals through questionnaire based on the theory of the Technology Acceptance Model. Results: In March 2012 we released and deployed the SCP, but only with the social network component. The pilot project lasted 6 months in the hospital and 2 primary care centers. From March to September 2012 we created 16 records in the Clinical Wall, all with a high priority. A total of 10 professionals took part in the exchange of messages: 3 internists and 7 general practitioners generated 33 messages. 12 of the 16 record (75%) were answered by the destination health professionals. The professionals valued positively all the items in the questionnaire. As part of the SCP, opensource tools for CDS will be incorporated to provide recommendations for medication and problem interactions, as well as to calculate indexes or scales from validated questionnaires. They will receive the patient summary information provided by the regional Electronic Health Record system through a web service with the information defined according to the virtual Medical Record specification. Conclusions: Clinical Wall has been developed to allow communication and coordination between the healthcare professionals involved in multimorbidity patient care. Agreed decisions were about coordination for appointment changing, patient conditions, diagnosis tests, and prescription changes and renewal. The application of interoperability standards and open source software can bridge the gap between knowledge and clinical practice, while enabling interoperability and scalability. Open source with the social network encourages adoption and facilitates collaboration. Although the results obtained for use indicators are still not as high as it was expected, based on the promising results obtained in the acceptance questionnaire of SMP, we expect that the new CDS tools will increase the use by the health professionals.

194,"Knowledge bases (KBs) have gradually become a valuable asset for many AI applications. While many current KBs are quite large, they are widely acknowledged as incomplete, especially lacking facts of long-tail entities, e.g., less famous persons. Existing approaches enrich KBs mainly on completing missing links or filling missing values. However, they only tackle a part of the enrichment problem and lack specific considerations regarding long-tail entities. In this paper, we propose a full-fledged approach to knowledge enrichment, which predicts missing properties and infers true facts of long-tail entities from the open Web. Prior knowledge from popular entities is leveraged to improve every enrichment step. Our experiments on the synthetic and real-world datasets and comparison with related work demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the approach."

196,"Introduction Significant changes in routine maternity care have been introduced globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce infection risk, but also due to lack of medical facilities, staff shortages and the unpredictable nature of the disease. However, it is yet to be established if specialised perinatal mental health (PMH) services have been similarly affected. As a Task Force in PMH and COVID-19 pandemic within Riseup-PPD COST Action, this study aims to identify changes in PMH practices, policies and protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Methods and analysis An online survey of experts in the PMH who are members of the COST Action 'Riseup-PPD' and the COST Action DEVOTION across 36 European countries will be conducted. A questionnaire on changes in PMH care practices during the COVID-19 Pandemic will be administered. It consists of open-ended questions, checklists and ratings on a 7-point scale addressing seven domains of interest in terms of PMH: (1) policies, guidelines and protocols; (2) PMH care practices at a national level; (3) evidence of best practice; (4) barriers to usual care; (5) resources invested; (6) benefits of investment in the policies and (7) short-term and long-term expectations of the policies. Data will be collected using Qualtrics. Descriptive statistics will be reported and differences between countries will be examined using the chi(2) statistic or Student's t-test. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from The Ethics Committee for Research in Life and Health Sciences of the University of Minho (Portugal) to undertake an anonymous online survey. The findings will be disseminated to professional audience through peer-review publication and presentations and shared widely with stakeholders, policy-makers and service user groups. A position paper will be developed to influence policy-making at a European level to alleviate the adversities caused by COVID-19."
197,"In India, there is a strong need of reform measures to improve the quality of medical education being imparted in various medical colleges and institutions. This is partly aggravated by the shortage of healthcare practitioners. As a solution for improving the quality of medical education, an emerging form of eLearning, namely, Massive Open Online Courseware (MOOC) could be used as a potential tool. With its varied advantages, MOOCs have a wide acceptance amongst the global community. MOOC replaces the traditional brick and mortar classrooms by providing an open online knowledge repository and enables a collaborative learning environment. However, for MOOCs to be accepted as a medium for imparting medical education in India, it is necessary that MOOCs is recognised by all the medical colleges and institutions. MOOCs would not only improve the quality of medical education but also, as a spin off, would result in the improvement of healthcare service delivery, thereby benefitting each and every citizen of India."
198,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a range of unprecedented disruptions to maternity care with documented impacts on perinatal outcomes such as stillbirth and preterm birth. Metropolitan Melbourne has endured one of the longest and most stringent lockdowns in globally. This paper presents the protocol for a multicentre study to monitor perinatal outcomes in Melbourne, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Multicentre observational study analysing monthly deidentified maternal and newborn outcomes from births >20 weeks at all 12 public maternity services in Melbourne. Data will be merged centrally to analyse outcomes and create run charts according to established methods for detecting non-random 'signals' in healthcare. Perinatal outcomes will include weekly rates of total births, stillbirths, preterm births, neonatal intensive care admissions, low Apgar scores and fetal growth restriction. Maternal outcomes will include weekly rates of: induced labour, caesarean section, births before arrival to hospital, postpartum haemorrhage, length of stay, general anaesthesia for caesarean birth, influenza and COVID-19 vaccination status, and gestation at first antenatal visit. A prepandemic median for all outcomes will be calculated for the period of January 2018 to March 2020. A significant shift is defined as >= 6 consecutive weeks, all above or below the prepandemic median. Additional statistical analyses such as regression, time series and survival analyses will be performed for an in-depth examination of maternal and perinatal outcomes of interests. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for the collaborative maternity and newborn dashboard project has been obtained from the Austin Health (HREC/64722/Austin-2020) and Mercy Health (ref. 2020-031)."
199,"Accessible Summary Pharmacists are an important source of support for people with learning disabilities, healthcare professionals and carers. Pharmacists can support carers and healthcare professionals to manage medicines in line with stopping over-medication of people with a learning disability, autism or both principles. Healthcare staff and carers were interviewed to see how they felt about working with a pharmacist and how this helped them to look after people with learning disabilities. Healthcare professionals and carers felt that the pharmacist was very helpful and listened to them. Background The issues surrounding the prescribing and monitoring of medications for people with learning disabilities and behaviours deemed to be challenging, and are complex in their management for patients, healthcare professionals and carers. The aim of the study was to explore the impact of the pharmacist independent prescriber on a medication clinic for people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours from the perspectives of healthcare professionals and carers in a UK mental health Trust setting. Materials and Methods Qualitative methods were used to provide an understanding of the participants' interactions with the pharmacist in the context of the medication clinic. Individual, semi-structured interviews were carried out with staff and carers, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was carried out to identify themes which illuminated the participants' experiences. Recruitment took place December 2017-August 2018. Results Nine participants took part (six staff and three full-time carers). Eight themes were constructed from the data: five from staff and three from the carer cohort: being open to innovation and change in collaborative practice, challenging traditional norms in collaborative approaches to person-centred care, proactive empowerment via maximisation of expertise and resources, supporting and empowering informed decision-making, encouraging collaborative debate around medication, establishing authentic and interactive dialogue, gaining trust of the pharmacist independent prescriber's role in the management of patients and feeling empowered to challenge ambiguity and inconsistency in prescribing practice. Conclusion The pharmacist independent prescriber is a valued asset, with high levels of interaction between all staff, carers and an integral aspect of services provided."
200,"The COVID-19 pandemic has stunned the global community with marked social and psychological ramifications. There are key challenges for psychiatry that require urgent attention to ensure mental health well-being for all - COVID-19-positive patients, healthcare professionals, first responders, people with psychiatric disorders and the general population. This editorial outlines some of these challenges and research questions, and serves as a preliminary framework of what needs to be addressed. Mental healthcare should be an integral component of healthcare policy and practice towards COVID-19. Collaborative efforts from psychiatric organisations and their members are required to maximise appropriate clinical and educational interventions while minimising stigma."
201,"Clinical validity assessments of gene-disease associations underpin analysis and reporting in diagnostic genomics, and yet wide variability exists in practice, particularly in use of these assessments for virtual gene panel design and maintenance. Harmonization efforts are hampered by the lack of agreed terminology, agreed gene curation standards, and platforms that can be used to identify and resolve discrepancies at scale. We undertook a systematic comparison of the content of 80 virtual gene panels used in two healthcare systems by multiple diagnostic providers in the United Kingdom and Australia. The process was enabled by a shared curation platform, PanelApp, and resulted in the identification and review of 2,144 discordant gene ratings, demonstrating the utility of sharing structured gene-disease validity assessments and collaborative discordance resolution in establishing national and international consensus."
202,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many countries, posing a threat to human health and safety, and putting tremendous pressure on the medical system. This paper proposes a novel SLAM technology us ing RGB and depth images to improve hospital operation efficiency, reduce the risk of doctor-patient cross-infection, and curb the spread of the COVID-19. Most current visual SLAM researches assume that the environment is stationary, which makes handling real-world scenarios such as hospitals a challenge. This paper proposes a method that effectively deals with SLAM problems for scenarios with dynamic objects, e.g., people and movable objects, based on the semantic descriptor extracted from images with help of a knowledge graph. Specifically, our method leverages a knowledge graph to construct a priori movement relationship between entities and establishes high-level semantic information. Built upon this knowledge graph, a semantic descriptor is constructed to describe the semantic information around key points, which is rotation-invariant and robust to illumination. The seamless integration of the knowledge graph and semantic descriptor helps eliminate the dynamic objects and improves the accuracy of track ing and positioning of robots in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted using data acquired from healthcare facilities, and semantic maps are established to meet the needs of robots for delivering medical services. In addition, to compare with the state-of-the-art methods, a publicly available dataset is used in our evaluation. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method demonstrated great improvement with respect to both accuracy and robustness in dynamic environments. The computational efficiency is also competitive. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
203,"Objectives Effective secondary stroke prevention strategies are suboptimally used. Novel development of interventions to enable healthcare professionals and stroke survivors to manage risk factors for stroke recurrence are required. We sought to engage key stakeholders in the design and evaluation of an intervention informed by a learning health system approach, to improve risk factor management and secondary prevention for stroke survivors with multimorbidity. Design Qualitative, including focus groups, semistructured interviews and usability evaluations. Data was audio recorded, transcribed and coded thematically. Participants Stroke survivors, carers, health and social care professionals, commissioners, policymakers and researchers. Setting Stroke survivors were recruited from the South London Stroke Register; health and social care professionals through South London general practices and King's College London (KCL) networks; carers, commissioners, policymakers and researchers through KCL networks. Results 53 stakeholders in total participated in focus groups, interviews and usability evaluations. Thirty-seven participated in focus groups and interviews, including stroke survivors and carers (n=11), health and social care professionals (n=16), commissioners and policymakers (n=6) and researchers (n=4). Sixteen participated in usability evaluations, including stroke survivors (n=8) and general practitioners (GPs; n=8). Eight themes informed the collaborative design of DOTT (Deciding On Treatments Together), a decision aid integrated with the electronic health record system, to be used in primary care during clinical consultations between the healthcare professional and stroke survivor. DOTT aims to facilitate shared decision-making on personalised treatments leading to improved treatment adherence and risk control. DOTT was found acceptable and usable among stroke survivors and GPs during a series of evaluations. Conclusions Adopting a user-centred data-driven design approach informed an intervention that is acceptable to users and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. A future feasibility study and subsequent clinical trial will provide evidence of the effectiveness of DOTT in reducing risk of stroke recurrence."
204,"IMPORTANCE Type 2 diabetes is a prevalent and morbid condition. Poor engagement with self-management can contribute to diabetes-associated distress and hinder diabetes control. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of Empowering Patients in Chronic Care (EPICC), an evidence-based intervention to improve diabetes-associated distress and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) levels after the intervention and after 6-month maintenance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This hybrid (implementation-effectiveness) randomized clinical trial was performed in Veterans Affairs clinics across Illinois, Indiana, and Texas from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017. Participants included adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA(1c) level >8.0%) who received primary care during the prior year in participating clinics. Data collection was completed on November 30, 2018, and data analysis was completed on June 30, 2020. All analyses were based on intention to treat. INTERVENTIONS Participants in EPICC attended 6 group sessions based on a collaborative goal-setting theory led by health care professionals. Clinicians conducted individual motivational interviewing sessions after each group. Usual care was enhanced (EUC) with diabetes education. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome consisted of changes in HbA(1c) levels after the intervention and during maintenance. Secondary outcomes included the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS), Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, and Lorig Self-efficacy Scale. Secondary implementation outcomes included reach, adoption, and implementation (number of sessions attended per patient). RESULTS A total of 280 participants with type 2 diabetes (mean [SD] age, 67.2 [8.4] years; 264 men [94.3]; 134 non-Hispanic White individuals [47.9%]) were equally randomized to EPICC or EUC. Participants receiving EPICC had significant postintervention improvements in HbA(1c) levels (F-1, (252) = 9.12, Cohen d = 0.36 [95% CI, 0.12-0.59]; P = .003) and DDS (F-1,F-245 = 9.06, Cohen d = 0.37 [95% CI, 0.13-0.60]; P = .003) compared with EUC. During maintenance, differences between the EUC and EPICC groups remained significant for DDS score (F-1,F-245 = 8.94, Cohen d = 0.36 [95% CI, 0.12-0.59]; P = .003) but not for HbA(1c), levels (F-1,F-252 = 0.29, Cohen d = 0.06 [95% CI, -0.17 to 0.30]; P = .60). Improvements in DDS scores were modest. There were no differences between EPICC and EUC in improvements after intervention or maintenance for either adherence or self-efficacy. Among all 4002 eligible patients, 280 (7.0%) enrolled in the study (reach). Each clinic conducted all planned EPICC sessions and cohorts (100% adoption). The EPICC group participants attended a mean (SD) of 4.34 (1.98) sessions, with 54 (38.6%) receiving all 6 sessions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A patient-empowerment approach using longitudinal collaborative goal setting and motivational interviewing is feasible in primary care. Improvements in HbA,, levels after the intervention were not sustained after maintenance. Modest improvements in diabetes-associated distress after the intervention were sustained after maintenance. Innovations to expand reach (eg, telemedicine-enabled shared appointments) and sustainability are needed."
205,"BackgroundGoverning interprofessional elderly care requires the commitment of many different organisations connected in mandated collaboratives. Research over a decade ago showed that the governance relied on clan-based mechanisms, while lacking formal rules and incentives for collaborations. Awareness and reflection were seen as first steps towards progression. We aim to identify critical governance features of contemporary mandated collaboratives by discussing cases introduced by the healthcare professionals and managers themselves.MethodsSemi-structured interviews (n = 24) with two regional mandated collaboratives took place from November 2019 to November 2020 in the Netherlands to learn more about critical governance features. The interviews were thematically analysed by the project team (authors) to synthesise the results and were subsequently validated during a focus group.ResultsCritical governance features of interorganisational activities in mandated collaboratives include the gradual formulation of shared vision and clear client-centred goals, building trust and acquaintanceship for the advancement of an open collaborative culture, establishing a non-extreme formalised governance structure through leadership, mutual trust and innovation support and facilitating information exchange and formalisation tools for optimal elderly care.ConclusionTrust and leadership form the backbone of interorganisational functioning. Interorganisational functioning should be seen in light of their national embedment and resources that are (being made) available, which makes them susceptible to constant change as they struggle with balancing between critical features in a fluid and intermingled governance context. The identified critical features of (contemporary) mandated collaboratives may aid in assessing and improving interprofessional functioning within integrated elderly care. International debate on governance expectations of mandated collaboratives may further contribute to sharpening the roles of both managers and healthcare professionals."
206,"Objectives To evaluate patient follow-up and complexity in cancer clinical trial delivery, using consensus methods to: (1) identify research professionals' priorities, (2) understand localised challenges, (3) define study complexity and workloads supporting the development of a trial rating and complexity assessment tool (TRACAT). Design A classic eDelphi completed in three rounds, conducted as the launch study to a multiphase national project (evaluating follow-up and complexity in cancer clinical trials). Setting Multicentre online survey involving professionals at National Health Service secondary care hospital sites in Scotland and England varied in scale, geographical location and patient populations. Participants Principal investigators at 13 hospitals across nine clinical research networks recruited 33 participants using pre-defined eligibility criteria to form a multidisciplinary panel. Main outcome measures Statements achieving a consensus level of 70% on a 7-point Likert-type scale and ranked trial rating indicators (TRIs) developed by research professionals. Results The panel developed 75 consensus statements illustrating factors contributing to complexity, follow-up intensity and operational performance in trial delivery, and specified 14 ranked TRIs. Seven open questions in the first qualitative round generated 531 individual statements. Iterative survey rounds returned rates of 82%, 82% and 93%. Conclusions Clinical trials operate within a dynamic, complex healthcare and innovation system where rapid scientific advances present opportunities and challenges for delivery organisations and professionals. Panellists highlighted cultural and organisational factors limiting the profession's potential to support growing trial complexity and patient follow-up. Enhanced communication, interoperability, funding and capacity have emerged as key priorities. Future operational models should test dialectic Singerian-based approaches respecting open dialogue and shared values. Research capacity building should prioritise innovative, collaborative approaches embedding validated review and evaluation models to understand changing operational needs and challenges. TRACAT provides a mechanism for continual knowledge assimilation to improve decision-making."
207,"Objective We introduce and review the concept of a study-a-thon as a catalyst for open science in medicine, utilizing harmonized real world, observation health data, tools, skills, and methods to conduct network studies, generating insights for those wishing to use study-a-thons for future research. Materials and Methods A series of historical study-a-thons since 2017 to present were reviewed for thematic insights as to the opportunity to accelerate the research method to conduct studies across therapeutic areas. Review of publications and experience of the authors generated insights to illustrate the conduct of study-a-thons, key learning, and direction for those wishing to conduct future such study-a-thons. Results A review of six study-a-thons have provided insights into their scientific impact, and 13 areas of insights for those wishing to conduct future study-a-thons. Defining aspects of the study-a-thon method for rapid, collaborative research through network studies reinforce the need to clear scientific rationale, tools, skills, and methods being collaboratively to conduct a focused study. Well-characterized preparatory, execution and postevent phases, coalescing skills, experience, data, clinical input (ensuring representative clinical context to the research query), and well-defined, logical steps in conducting research via the study-a-thon method are critical. Conclusions A study-a-thon is a focused multiday research event generating reliable evidence on a specific medical topic across different countries and health systems. In a study-a-thon, a multidisciplinary team collaborate to create an accelerated contribution to scientific evidence and clinical practice. It critically accelerates the research process, without inhibiting the quality of the research output and evidence generation, through a reproducible process. Lay Summary The research process is generally time-consuming, requiring considerable efforts and resources and planning over an extended duration of time before its results, such as via publications. Meanwhile, patients, clinicians, and healthcare providers need evidence to support decision-making from individual treatment to populations and public health policy, and more quickly than we have been used to, to date. This article describes an approach to accelerating the research process, bringing together relevant research and clinical practitioners, whilst not undermining confidence in the research results. Within this article the research event, or study-a-thon, is described, using six examples since 2017, within an international research network, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI). These examples help illustrate the steps required to conduct a study-a-thon, the use of health data under the right conditions, and learning from this process for others to consider using study-a-thons to accelerate their own research process where relevant. For the authors and colleagues in the OHDSI network, the open nature of conducting research via study-a-thons can also ensure full transparency of the process for all involved, as well as being able to reproduce results more readily, a key principle in good scientific conduct."
208,"Objective: Describe utilization and satisfaction in a specialty integrated care program for children with severe, chronic respiratory insufficiency (CRI). Subjects: Enrollees of the Critical Care, Anesthesia, Perioperative Extension (CAPE) and Home Ventilation Program. Methods: Children with CRI received home visits, care coordination, and on-demand 24/7 access to physicians. Program activity and outcomes were recorded for 3 years using an adapted Care Coordination Measurement Tool() version. Parents completed the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). Patient characteristics, program activity, clinical outcomes, utilization, and satisfaction were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: CAPE provided care for 320 patients from 2012 to 2014 with a median of 7 encounters per year. Neuromuscular (n=132, 41%), chronic lung disease (n=37,12%), and congenital heart disease (n=13, 4%) represented the majority of underlying conditions. Services included 905 home, 504 clinic, and 3633 telephone encounters, of which 43.6% included a care coordination activity. CAHPS (n=102) revealed that 92.1% (n=93) of children had at least one non-urgent (i.e., routine) visit and nearly two-thirds (64.7%, n=66) reported the need for urgent or emergency care. Overall, parents were highly satisfied with CAPE, with a mean satisfaction rating of 9.3 (+/- 1.3) out of 10. Most parents reported that the CAPE team understood the child's (96.0%, n=95) and family's day-to-day life (86.9%, n=86). Conclusions: When given open access to an intregated care program, children in our highly complex population required a median of 7 encounters per year. We believe that this experience is scalable and may inform other organizations contemplating similar services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
209,"Introduction: Advanced practice nurses are needed to fill the primary healthcare gap in the United States. Advanced practice/graduate nursing students were profoundly affected by the coronavirus pandemic in ways that may impact their educational experience. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the influence of the coronavirus pandemic on the educational experience of graduate nursing students. Methods: An exploratory descriptive qualitative study using semistructured video conferencing interviews of 11 graduate nursing students at one university in the United States was conducted during July 2020. Data were explored using theme analysis. Results: Four themes expressing the pandemic's impact on graduate student experience were identified: Alteration in human connections; Agility in action; Collaborative construction of change; and Metamorphosis emerging from disruption. The pandemic brought an alteration in how students connected with faculty, other students, and family. Many faculty and students responded with agility to the new mandates for social distancing. The students and faculty worked together to construct changes needed to provide the students with the required components of graduate education. These factors together created a metamorphosis in the functioning of the institution, breaking through hierarchical barriers in academia. Conclusion: The disruption in graduate nursing education due to the pandemic led to opportunities, including swift faculty innovation, a collaborative spirit between faculty and students, and new appreciation for connections with faculty and fellow students. Continuing intentional implementation of these opportunities would benefit students' experiences moving forward."
210,"Background: Interorganizational collaboration management theory contends that cooperation between distinct but related organizations can yield innovation and competitive advantage to the participating organization. Yet, it is unclear if a multi-institutional collaborative can improve quality outcomes across communities. Methods: We developed a large regional collaborative network of 15 hospitals and 24 emergency medical service agencies surrounding Dallas, Texas, and collected patient-level data on treatment times for acute myocardial infarctions. Using a pre-/posttest research design, we applied median tests of differences to explore outcome changes between groups and over the 6-year period, using data extracted from participating hospital electronic health records. Results: We analyzed temporal trends and changes in treatment times for 2302 patientswith ST-elevationmyocardial infarction between the pre-and posttest groups. We found a statistically significant 19-minute median reduction in the key outcome metric (total ischemic time, the time difference between the patient's first reported symptoms and the definitive opening of the artery). This represents a 10.8% community-wide improvement over time. Conclusions: Interorganizational collaboration focused on quality improvement can impact population health across a community. This study provides a basis for broader understanding and participation by health care organizations in multi-institutional community change efforts."
211,Background There is a global drive to improve access to mental healthcare by scaling up integrated mental health into primary healthcare (PHC) systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Aims To investigate systems-level implications of efforts to scale-up integrated mental healthcare into PHC in districts in six LMICs. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 121 managers and service providers. Transcribed interviews were analysed using framework analysis guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and World Health Organization basic building blocks. Results Ensuring that interventions are synergistic with existing health system features and strengthening of the healthcare system building blocks to support integrated chronic care and tasksharing were identified as aiding integration efforts. The latter includes (a) strengthening governance to include technical support for integration efforts as well as multisectoral collaborations; (b) ring-fencing mental health budgets at district level; (c) a critical mass of mental health specialists to support task-sharing; (d) including key mental health indicators in the health information system; (e) psychotropic medication included on free essential drug lists and (f) enabling collaborative and community-oriented PHC-service delivery platforms and continuous quality improvement to aid service delivery challenges in implementation. Conclusions Scaling up integrated mental healthcare in PHC in LMICs is more complex than training general healthcare providers. Leveraging existing health system processes that are synergistic with chronic care services and strengthening healthcare system building blocks to provide a more enabling context for integration are important.
212,"During the last decades design has been expanded as a discipline and conquered new territories. This expansion has been the cause and also the consequence of an evolution in the way design is understood and used. Multiple reasons support this transformation, the emergence of new challenges of global scale in areas like sustainability, healthcare, and urban life amongst them. These global challenges require all disciplines embrace collaborative approaches. Design hasn't been alien to this process; on the contrary very interesting perspectives have emerged. The purpose of this paper supported by recent research carried out in the UK is to open a space for discussion about the definitions of design found in academia in areas like sustainability in comparison with the definitions businesses give to design today. We believe having this discussion is very important for the future of design and designing in industry and beyond."
213,"ObjectivesThe rapid onset and progressive course of the COVID-19 pandemic challenged primary care practices to generate rapid solutions to unique circumstances, creating a natural experiment of effectiveness, resilience, financial stability and governance across primary care models. We aimed to characterise how practices in Melbourne, Australia modified clinical and organisational routines in response to the pandemic in 2020-2021 and identify factors that influenced these changes.DesignProspective, qualitative, participatory case study design using constant comparative data analysis, conducted between April 2020 and February 2021. Participant general practitioner (GP) investigators were involved in study design, recruitment of other participants, data collection and analysis. Data analysis included investigator diaries, structured practice observation, documents and interviews.SettingThe cases were six Melbourne practices of varying size and organisational model.ParticipantsGP investigators approached potential participants. Practice healthcare workers were interviewed by social scientists on three occasions, and provided feedback on presentations of preliminary findings.ResultsWe conducted 58 interviews with 26 practice healthcare workers including practice owners, practice managers, GPs, receptionists and nurses; and six interviews with GP investigators. Data saturation was achieved within each practice and across the sample. The pandemic generated changes to triage, clinical care, infection control and organisational routines, particularly around telehealth. While collaboration and trust increased within several practices, others fragmented, leaving staff isolated and demoralised. Financial and organisational stability, collaborative problem solving, creative leadership and communication (internally and within the broader healthcare sector) were major influences on practice ability to negotiate the pandemic.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the complex influences on primary care practices, and reinforces the strengths of clinician participation in research design, conduct and analysis. Two implications are: telehealth, triage and infection management innovations are likely to continue; the existing payment system provides inadequate support to primary care in a global pandemic."
214,"While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic placed a heavy burden on healthcare systems worldwide, it also induced urgent mobilisation of research teams to develop treatments preventing or curing the disease and its consequences. It has, therefore, challenged critical care research to rapidly focus on specific fields while forcing critical care physicians to make difficult ethical decisions. This narrative review aims to summarise critical care research -from organisation to research fields- in this pandemic setting and to highlight opportunities to improve research efficiency in the future, based on what is learned from COVID-19. This pressure on research revealed, i.e., (i) the need to harmonise regulatory processes between countries, allowing simplified organisation of international research networks to improve their efficiency in answering large-scale questions; (ii) the importance of developing translational research from which therapeutic innovations can emerge; (iii) the need for improved triage and predictive scores to rationalise admission to the intensive care unit. In this context, key areas for future critical care research and better pandemic preparedness are artificial intelligence applied to healthcare, characterisation of long-term symptoms, and ethical considerations. Such collaborative research efforts should involve groups from both high and low-to-middle income countries to propose worldwide solutions. As a conclusion, stress tests on healthcare organisations should be viewed as opportunities to design new research frameworks and strategies. Worldwide availability of research networks ready to operate is essential to be prepared for next pandemics. Importantly, researchers and physicians should prioritise realistic and ethical goals for both clinical care and research. (C) 2022 The Authors.

215,"Background: Convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat COVID-19 and is under investigation in numerous randomized clinical trials, but results are publicly available only for a small number of trials. The objective of this study was to assess the benefits of convalescent plasma treatment compared to placebo or no treatment and all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19, using data from all available randomized clinical trials, including unpublished and ongoing trials (Open Science Framework, ). Methods: In this collaborative systematic review and meta-analysis, clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), the Cochrane COVID-19 register, the LOVE database, and PubMed were searched until April 8, 2021. Investigators of trials registered by March 1, 2021, without published results were contacted via email. Eligible were ongoing, discontinued and completed randomized clinical trials that compared convalescent plasma with placebo or no treatment in COVID-19 patients, regardless of setting or treatment schedule. Aggregated mortality data were extracted from publications or provided by investigators of unpublished trials and combined using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman random effects model. We investigated the contribution of unpublished trials to the overall evidence. Results: A total of 16,477 patients were included in 33 trials (20 unpublished with 3190 patients, 13 published with 13,287 patients). 32 trials enrolled only hospitalized patients (including 3 with only intensive care unit patients). Risk of bias was low for 29/33 trials. Of 8495 patients who received convalescent plasma, 1997 died (23%), and of 7982 control patients, 1952 died (24%). The combined risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.92; 1.02) with between-study heterogeneity not beyond chance (I-2 = 0%). The RECOVERY trial had 69.8% and the unpublished evidence 25.3% of the weight in the meta-analysis. Conclusions: Convalescent plasma treatment of patients with COVID-19 did not reduce all-cause mortality. These results provide strong evidence that convalescent plasma treatment for patients with COVID-19 should not be used outside of randomized trials. Evidence synthesis from collaborations among trial investigators can inform both evidence generation and evidence application in patient care."
216,"Studying large-scale collaborative systems engineering projects across teams with differing intellectual property clearances, or healthcare solutions where sensitive patient data needs to be partially shared, or similar multi-user information systems over databases, all boils down to a common mathematical framework. Updateable views (lenses) and more generally bidirectional transformations are abstractions to study the challenge of exchanging information between participants with different read access privileges. The view provided to each participant must be different due to access control or other limitations, yet also consistent in a certain sense, to enable collaboration towards common goals. A collaboration system must apply bidirectional synchronization to ensure that after a participant modifies their view, the views of other participants are updated so that they are consistent again. While bidirectional transformations (synchronizations) have been extensively studied, there are new challenges that are unique to the multidirectional case. If complex consistency constraints have to be maintained, synchronizations that work fine in isolation may not compose well. We demonstrate and characterize a failure mode of the emergent behaviour, where a consistency restoration mechanism undoes the work of other participants. On the other end of the spectrum, we study the case where synchronizations work especially well together: we characterize very well-behaved multidirectional transformations, a non-trivial generalization from the bidirectional case. For the former challenge, we introduce a novel concept of controllability, while for the latter one, we propose a novel formal notion of faithful decomposition. Additionally, the paper proposes several novel properties of multidirectional transformations."
217,"Historical reviews of PACS (picture archiving and communication system) and imaging informatics development from different points of view have been published in the past (Huang in Euro J Radiol 78: 163-176, 2011; Lemke in Euro J Radiol 78: 177-183, 2011; Inamura and Jong in Euro J Radiol 78: 184-189, 2011). This retrospective attempts to look at the topic from a different angle by identifying certain basic medical imaging inventions in the 1960s and 1970s which had conceptually defined basic components of PACS guiding its course of development in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as subsequent imaging informatics research in the 2000s. In medical imaging, the emphasis was on the innovations at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, research and training support from US government agencies and public and private medical imaging manufacturers became available for training of young talents in biomedical physics and for developing the key components required for PACS development. In the 2000s, computer hardware and software as well as communication networks advanced by leaps and bounds, opening the door for medical imaging informatics to flourish. Because many key components required for the PACS operation were developed by the UCLA PACS Team and its collaborative partners in the 1980s, this presentation is centered on that aspect. During this period, substantial collaborative research efforts by many individual teams in the US and in Japan were highlighted. Credits are due particularly to the Pattern Recognition Laboratory at Georgetown University, and the computed radiography (CR) development at the Fuji Electric Corp. in collaboration with Stanford University in the 1970s; the Image Processing Laboratory at UCLA in the 1980s-1990s; as well as the early PACS development at the Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan, in the late 1970s, and film scanner and digital radiography developed by Konishiroku Photo Ind. Co. Ltd. (Konica-Minolta), Japan, in the 1980-1990s. Major support from the US National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies and private medical imaging industry are appreciated. The NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Advanced Study Institute (ASI) sponsored the International PACS Conference at Evian, France, in 1990, the contents and presentations of which convinced a half dozen high-level US military healthcare personnel, including surgeons and radiologists, that PACS was feasible and would greatly streamline the current military healthcare services. The impact of the post-conference summary by these individuals to their superiors opened the doors for long-term support of PACS development by the US Military Healthcare Services. PACS and imaging informatics have thus emerged as a daily clinical necessity."
218,"Objective This scoping study has been conducted to map the literature and provide a descriptive synthesis on the barriers and facilitators of the integration of oral health into primary care. Methods Grounded in the Rainbow conceptual model and using the Levac et al six-stage framework, we performed a systematic search of electronic databases, organisational websites and grey literature from 1978 to April 2016. All publications with a focus on the integration of oral health into primary care were included except commentaries and editorials. Thematic analyses were performed to synthesise the results. Results From a total of 1619 citations, 58 publications were included in the review. Barrier-related themes included: lack of political leadership and healthcare policies; implementation challenges; discipline-oriented education; lack of continuity of care and services and patients' oral healthcare needs. The facilitators of integration were supportive policies and resources allocation, interdisciplinary education, collaborative practices between dental and other healthcare professionals, presence of local strategic leaders and geographical proximity. Discussion and public health implications This work has advanced the knowledge on the barriers and facilitators at each integration domain and level, which may be helpful if the healthcare organisations decide to integrate oral health and dental services into primary care. The scoping review findings could be useful for both dental and medical workforce and allied primary healthcare providers. They could also guide the development of healthcare policies that support collaborative practices and patient-centred care in the field of primary care."
219,"Background There are few examples of the practical application of the concepts of social accountability, as defined by the World Bank and WHO, to health system change. This paper describes a robust approach led by First Nations Health Authority and the Rural Coordination Centre of British Columbia. This was achieved using partnerships in British Columbia, Canada, where the health system features inequities in service and outcomes for rural and Indigenous populations. Social accountability is achieved when all stakeholders come together simultaneously as partners and agree on a path forward. This approach has enabled socially accountable healthcare, effecting change in the healthcare system by addressing the needs of the population. Innovation Our innovative approach uses social accountability engagement to counteract persistent health inequities. This involves an adaptation of the Boelen Health Partnership model (policymakers, health administrators, health professionals, academics and community members) extended by addition of linked sectors (eg, industry and not-for-profits) to the 'Partnership Pentagram Plus'. We used appreciative inquiry and deliberative dialogue focused on the rural scale and integrating Indigenous ways of knowing along with western scientific traditions ('two-eyed seeing'). Using this approach, partners are brought together to identify common interests and direction as a learning community. Equitable engagement and provision of space as 'peers' and 'partners' were key to this process. Groups with varying perspectives came together to create solutions, building on existing strengths and new collaborative approaches to address specific issues in the community and health services delivery. A resulting provincial table reflecting the Pentagram Plus model has fostered policies and practices over the last 3 years that have resulted in meaningful collaborations for health service change. Conclusion This paper presents the application of the 'Partnership Pentagram Plus' approach and uses appreciative inquiry and deliberative dialogue to bring about practical and positive change to rural and Indigenous communities."
220,"The tragic failure of the global supply chain in the face of the current coronavirus outbreak has caused acute shortages of essential frontline medical devices and personal protective equipment, crushing fear among frontline health workers and causing fundamental concerns about the sustainability of the health system. Much more coordination, integration, and management of global supply chains will be needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemics. This article describes the pressing need to revisit the governance and resilience of the supply chains that amplified the crisis at pandemic scale. We propose a model that profiles critical stockpiles and improves production efficiency through new technologies such as advanced analytics and blockchain. A new governance system that supports intervention by public-health authorities during critical emergencies is central to our recommendation, both in the face of the current crisis and to be better prepared for potential future crises. These reinforcements offer the potential to minimize the compromise of our healthcare workers and health systems due to infection exposure and build capacity toward preparedness and action for a future outbreak."
221,"BackgroundTo meet the complex needs of healthcare delivery, the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) introduced Physician Assistants (PAs) into the Ontario health care system in 2006 with the goal of helping to increase access to care, decrease wait times, improve continuity of care and provide a flexible addition to the healthcare workforce. The characterization of healthcare organizations as complex adaptive systems (CAS) may offer insight into the relationships and interactions that optimize and restrict successful PA integration. The aim of this study is to explore the integration of PAs across multiple case settings and to understand the role of PAs within complex adaptive systems.MethodsAn exploratory, multiple-case study was used to examine PA role integration in four settings: family medicine, emergency medicine, general surgery, and inpatient medicine. Interviews were conducted with 46 healthcare providers and administrators across 13 hospitals and 6 family medicine clinics in Ontario, Canada. Analysis was conducted in three phases including an inductive thematic analysis within each of the four cases, a cross-case thematic analysis, and a broader, deductive exploration of cross-case patterns pertaining to specific complexity theory principles of interest.ResultsForty-six health care providers were interviewed across 19 different healthcare sites. Support for PA contributions across various health care settings, the importance of role awareness, supervisory relationship attributes, and role vulnerability are interconnected and dynamic. Findings represent the experiences of PAs and other healthcare providers, and demonstrate how the PAs willingness to work and ability to build relationships allows for the establishment of interprofessional, collaborative, and person-centered care. As a self-organizing agent in complex adaptive systems (i.e., health organizations), PA role exploration revealed patterns of team behavior, non-linear interconnections, open relationships, dynamic systems, and the legacy of role implementation as defined by complexity theory.ConclusionsBy exploring the role of PAs across multiple sites, the complexity theory lens concurrently fosters an awareness of emerging patterns, relationships and non-linear interactions within the defined context of the Ontario healthcare system. By establishing collaborative, interprofessional care models in hospital and community settings, PAs are making a significant contribution to Ontario healthcare settings."
222,"Background: The management of patients with complex care needs requires the expertise of health care providers from multiple settings and specialties. As such, there is a need for cross-setting, cross-disciplinary solutions that address deficits in communication and continuity of care. We have developed a Web-based tool for clinical collaboration, called Loop, which assembles the patient and care team in a virtual space for the purpose of facilitating communication around care management. Objective: The objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate the feasibility of integrating a tool like Loop into current care practices and to capture preliminary measures of the effect of Loop on continuity of care, quality of care, symptom distress, and health care utilization. Methods: We conducted an open-label pilot cluster randomized controlled trial allocating patients with advanced cancer (defined as stage III or IV disease) with >= 3 months prognosis, their participating health care team and caregivers to receive either the Loop intervention or usual care. Outcome data were collected from patients on a monthly basis for 3 months. Trial feasibility was measured with rate of uptake, as well as recruitment and system usage. The Picker Continuity of Care subscale, Palliative care Outcomes Scale, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and Ambulatory and Home Care Record were patient self-reported measures of continuity of care, quality of care, symptom distress, and health services utilization, respectively. We conducted a content analysis of messages posted on Loop to understand how the system was used. Results: Nineteen physicians (oncologists or palliative care physicians) were randomized to the intervention or control arms. One hundred twenty-seven of their patients with advanced cancer were approached and 48 patients enrolled. Of 24 patients in the intervention arm, 20 (83.3%) registered onto Loop. In the intervention and control arms, 12 and 11 patients completed three months of follow-up, respectively. A mean of 1.2 (range: 0 to 4) additional healthcare providers with an average total of 3 healthcare providers participated per team. An unadjusted between-arm increase of +11.4 was observed on the Picker scale in favor of the intervention arm. Other measures showed negligible changes. Loop was primarily used for medical care management, symptom reporting, and appointment coordination. Conclusions: The results of this study show that implementation of Loop was feasible. It provides useful information for planning future studies further examining effectiveness and team collaboration. Numerically higher scores were observed for the Loop arm relative to the control arm with respect to continuity of care. Future work is required to understand the incentives and barriers to participation so that the implementation of tools like Loop can be optimized."
223,"Objective We assessed the process of recognising abnormal bodily changes, interpretations and attributions, and help-seeking behaviour among community-based Ugandan women with possible symptoms of breast and cervical cancer, in order to inform health interventions aiming to promote timely detection and diagnosis of cancer. Design Qualitative in-depth interviews. Setting Rural and urban communities in Uganda. Participants Women who participated in the African Women Awareness of CANcer cross-sectional survey who disclosed potential breast and cervical cancer symptoms were eligible; recruitment was purposive. Interviews were conducted in women's homes, lasted between 40 and 90 min, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated to English. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and subthemes, underpinned by the conceptual framework of the Model of Pathways to Treatment. Results 23 women were interviewed: 10 had potential symptoms of breast cancer and 13 of cervical cancer. Themes regarding symptom appraisal and help-seeking included the: (1) detection and interpretation of abnormal bodily sensations; (2) lay consultations regarding bodily changes; (3) iterative process of inferring and attributing illnesses to the bodily changes; (4) restricted disclosure of symptoms to lay people due to concerns about privacy and fear of stigmatisation; (5) help-seeking from multiple sources including both traditional and biomedical health practitioners, and (6) multiple perceived barriers to help-seeking including long waiting times, lack of medicines, absenteeism of healthcare professionals, and lack of money for transport and medical bills. Conclusion Women with potential symptoms of breast and cervical cancer undergo complex processes of symptom interpretation, attributing symptoms or inferring illness, and lay consultations before undertaking help-seeking and management. Increasing community understanding of breast and cervical cancer symptoms, and tackling perceived barriers to health-seeking, could lead to prompt and appropriate symptom appraisal and help-seeking, and contribute to improving cancer outcomes."
224,"Introduction: Robotic cholecystectomy (RC) is a recent innovation in minimally invasive gallbladder surgery. The IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment, long-term study) framework aims to provide a safe method for evaluating innovative procedures. This study aimed to understand how RC was introduced, in accordance with IDEAL guidelines. Methods: Systematic searches were used to identify studies reporting RC. Eligible studies were classified according to IDEAL stage and data were collected on general study characteristics, patient selection, governance procedures, surgeon/centre expertise, and outcome reporting. Results: Of 1425 abstracts screened, 90 studies were included (5 case reports, 38 case series, 44 non-randomized comparative studies, and 3 randomized clinical trials). Sixty-four were single-centre and 15 were prospective. No authors described their work in the context of IDEAL. One study was classified as IDEAL stage 1, 43 as IDEAL 2a, 43 as IDEAL 2b, and three as IDEAL 3. Sixty-four and 51 provided inclusion and exclusion criteria respectively. Ethical approval was reported in 51 and conflicts of interest in 34. Only 21 reported provision of training for surgeons in RC. A total of 864 outcomes were reported; 198 were used in only one study. Only 30 reported a follow-up interval which, in 13, was 1 month or less. Conclusion: The IDEAL framework was not followed during the adoption of RC. Few studies were conducted within a research setting, many were retrospective, and outcomes were heterogeneous. There is a need to implement appropriate tools to facilitate the incremental evaluation and reporting of surgical innovation."
225,"Asthma frequently occurs in association with allergic rhinitis and a combined management approach has been suggested. The Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test (CARAT) is the first questionnaire to assess control of both diseases concurrently. However, to have an impact on healthcare it needs to be disseminated and adopted. In this paper we discuss the dissemination of CARAT in different countries and its possible applications in primary care. At present, the adaptation of CARAT for use in different languages and cultures is being led by volunteer researchers and clinicians in 15 countries. Website and smartphone applications have been developed, and a free open model of distribution was adopted to contribute to the dissemination of CARAT. Examples of dissemination activities include distribution of leaflets and posters, educational sessions on the use of the questionnaire in the follow-up of patients, development of clinical studies, collaborations with professional organisations and health authorities, and the inclusion of CARAT in clinical guidelines. The adoption of innovations is an important challenge in healthcare today, and research on the degree of success of dissemination strategies using suitable methods and metrics is much needed. We propose that CARAT can be used in a range of settings and circumstances in primary care for clinical, research and audit purposes, within the overall aim of increasing awareness of the level of disease control and strengthening the partnership between patients and doctors in the management of asthma and rhinitis.

226,"BackgroundHealthcare data is a rich yet underutilized resource due to its disconnected, heterogeneous nature. A means of connecting healthcare data and integrating it with additional open and social data in a secure way can support the monumental challenge policy-makers face in safely accessing all relevant data to assist in managing the health and wellbeing of all. The goal of this study was to develop a novel health data platform within the MIDAS (Meaningful Integration of Data Analytics and Services) project, that harnesses the potential of latent healthcare data in combination with open and social data to support evidence-based health policy decision-making in a privacy-preserving manner. MethodsThe MIDAS platform was developed in an iterative and collaborative way with close involvement of academia, industry, healthcare staff and policy-makers, to solve tasks including data storage, data harmonization, data analytics and visualizations, and open and social data analytics. The platform has been piloted and tested by health departments in four European countries, each focusing on different region-specific health challenges and related data sources. ResultsA novel health data platform solving the needs of Public Health decision-makers was successfully implemented within the four pilot regions connecting heterogeneous healthcare datasets and open datasets and turning large amounts of previously isolated data into actionable information allowing for evidence-based health policy-making and risk stratification through the application and visualization of advanced analytics. ConclusionsThe MIDAS platform delivers a secure, effective and integrated solution to deal with health data, providing support for health policy decision-making, planning of public health activities and the implementation of the Health in All Policies approach. The platform has proven transferable, sustainable and scalable across policies, data and regions."
227,"Background and objective: The beneficial effects of self-care include improved well-being and lower morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. In this article we address the current state of self-care research and propose an agenda for future research based on the inaugural conference of the International Center for Self-Care Research held in Rome, Italy in June 2019. The vision of this Center is a world where self-care is prioritized by individuals, families, and communities and is the first line of approach in every health care encounter. The mission of the Center is to lead the self-care research endeavor, improving conceptual clarity and promoting interdisciplinary work informed by a shared vision addressing knowledge gaps. A focused research agenda can deepen our theoretical understanding of self-care and the mechanisms underlying self-care, which can contribute to the development of effective interventions that improve outcomes. Methods: During conference discussions, we identified seven major reasons why self-care is challenging, which can be grouped into the general categories of behavior change and illness related factors. We identified six specific knowledge gaps that, if addressed, may help to address these challenges: the influence of habit formation on behavior change, resilience in the face of stressful life events that interfere with self-care, the influence of culture on self-care behavioral choices, the difficulty performing self-care with multiple chronic conditions, self-care in persons with severe mental illness, and the influence of others (care partners, family, peer supporters, and healthcare professionals) on self-care. Plans to achieve results: To achieve the vision and mission of the Center, we will lead a collaborative program of research that addresses self-care knowledge gaps and improves outcomes, create a supportive international network for knowledge transfer and support of innovations in self-care research, and support and train others in self-care research. Beyond these specific short-term goals, important policy implications of this work are discussed. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

228,"Background Migrants are often more vulnerable to health issues compared to host populations, and particularly the women. Therefore, migrant women's health is important in promoting health equity in society. Participation and empowerment are central concepts in health promotion and in community-based participatory research aimed at enhancing health. The aim of this study was to identify conditions for health promotion together with women migrants through a community-based participatory research approach. Methods A community-based participatory research approach was applied in the programme Collaborative Innovations for Health Promotion in a socially disadvantaged area in Malmo, Sweden, where this study was conducted. Residents in the area were invited to participate in the research process on health promotion. Health promoters were recruited to the programme to encourage participation and a group of 21 migrant women participating in the programme were included in this study. A qualitative method was used for the data collection, namely, the story-dialogue method, where a process involving issue, reflections and actions guided the dialogues. The material was partly analysed together with the women, inspired by the second-level synthesis. Results Two main health issues, mental health and long-term pain, were reflected upon during the dialogues, and two main themes were elaborated in the process of analysis: Prioritising spare time to promote mental health and Collaboration to address healthcare dissatisfaction related to long-term pain. The women shared that they wanted to learn more about the healthcare system, and how to complain about it, and they also saw the togetherness as a strategy along the way. A decision was made to start a health circle in the community to continue collaboration on health promotion. Conclusions The community-based participatory research approach and the story dialogues constituted an essential foundation for the empowerment process. The health circle provides a forum for further work on conditions for health promotion, as a tool to support migrant women's health."
229,"Objectives To overcome the shortage of personal protective equipment and airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) in the COVID-19 pandemic, a collaborative team of research engineers and clinical physicians worked to build a novel negative pressure environment in the hopes of improving healthcare worker and patient safety. The team then sought to test the device's efficacy in generating and maintaining negative pressure. The goal proved prescient as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later recommended that all barrier devices use negative pressure. Methods Initially, engineers observed simulations of various aerosol- and droplet-generating procedures using hospital beds and stretchers to determine the optimal working dimensions of the containment device. Several prototypes were made based on these dimensions which were combined with filters and various flow-generating devices. Then, the airflow generated and the pressure differential within the device during simulated patient care were measured, specifically assessing its ability to create a negative pressure environment consistent with standards published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results The portable fans were unable to generate any airflow and were dropped from further testing. The vacuums tested were all able to generate a negative pressure environment with the magnitude of pressure differential increasing with the vacuum horsepower. Only the 3.5-horsepower Shop-Vac, however, generated a -3.0 pascal (Pa) pressure gradient, exceeding the CDC-recommended minimum of -2.5 Pa for AIIRs. Conclusion A collaborative team of physicians and engineers demonstrated the efficacy of a prototype portable negative pressure environment, surpassing the negative pressure differential recommended by the CDC."
230,"Objectives To analyse differences in regional distribution and inequality in health-resource allocation at the hospital and primary health centre (PHC) levels in Shanghai over 7 years. Design A longitudinal survey using 2010-2016 data, which were collected for analysis. Setting The study was conducted at the hospital and PHC levels in Shanghai, China. Outcome measures Ten health-resource indicators were used to measure health-resource distribution at the hospital and PHC levels. In addition, the Theil Index was calculated to measure inequality in health-resource allocation. Results All quantities of healthcare resources per 1000 people in hospitals and PHCs increased across Shanghai districts from 2010 to 2016. Relative to suburban districts, the central districts had higher ratios, both in terms of doctors and equipment, and had faster growth in the doctor indicator and slower growth in the equipment indicator in hospitals and PHCs. The Theil Indices of all health-resource allocation in hospitals had higher values compared with those in PHCs every year from 2010 to 2016; furthermore, the Theil Indices of the indicators, except for technicians and doctors in hospitals, all exhibited downward time trends in hospitals and PHCs. Conclusions Increased healthcare resources and reduced inequality of health-resource allocation in Shanghai during the 7 years indicated that measures taken by the Shanghai government to deepen the new round of healthcare reform in China since 2009 had been successful. Meanwhile there still existed regional difference between urban and rural areas and inequality across different medical institutions. To solve these problems, we prescribe increased wages, improved working conditions, and more open access to career development for doctors and nurses; reduced investments in redundant equipment in hospitals; and other incentives for balancing the health workforce between hospitals and PHCs."
231,"For almost a decade, regulators and pharmaceutical industry groups have been interested in electronic source (eSource) in clinical trials (Nordo et al. in Learn Health Syst 3:e10076, 2019). eSource may provide efficiencies and value; however, eSource adoption is fragmented and slow. Acceleration of eSource adoption is a critical step in modernizing the conduct of clinical trials. The desired future state is one in which all source data, acquired through any context (e.g., healthcare delivery, chronic disease management) and actor (e.g., healthcare professional, patient, caregiver), are completely electronic, adequate in quality, and fully acceptable in clinical trial submissions by regulators worldwide. Achieving this desired future state requires transformative change management to foster adoption and minimize the burden of implementing eSource. Realizing this vision requires collaborative and dedicated efforts from multiple stakeholders, including patients, clinical trial participants, sites, technology vendors, standards organizations, regulators, payers, and sponsors. Stakeholders should align upon guidance to promote data integrity, data privacy, data security, and interoperability. The eSource revolution requires open dialogue, inclusive of shared learnings among stakeholders, to collectively and rapidly advance adoption. Adoption of eSource will optimize clinical research by enabling faster access to research data and more rapid decision-making, increasing clinical trial efficiency. Furthermore, adoption of eSource will improve data integrity by allowing direct data flow from the source to the sponsor's system, with minimal or no human intervention. This paper provides the TransCelerate point of view (POV) and recommendations to achieve the future state vision of complete utilization of eSource data in clinical trials and builds on previous TransCelerate eSource publications."
232,"Introduction Healthcare-associated infections are an important patient safety concern, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Infection prevention and control implemented in healthcare settings are largely focused on the practices of healthcare professionals. Patient and family engagement is also recognised as an important patient safety strategy. The extent to which patients and families can be engaged, their specific roles and the strategies that support their engagement in infection prevention remain unclear. The overarching objective of the proposed study is to explore how patients and families can effectively be engaged in infection prevention by developing a consensus framework with key stakeholders. Design and methods The proposed study is based on a cross-sectional exploratory study at one of the largest university hospitals in North America (Montreal, Canada). The targeted population is all healthcare professionals, managers and other non-clinical staff members who work on clinical units, and the in-patients and their families. The study is based on Q methodology that takes advantage of both quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the consensus among the various stakeholders. This exploratory Q research approach will provide a structured way to elicit the stakeholders' perspectives on patient and family engagement in infection prevention. Ethics and dissemination The research ethics board approved this study. The research team plans to disseminate the findings through different channels of communication targeting healthcare professionals, managers in healthcare settings, and patients and family caregivers. The findings will also be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals in healthcare management and in quality and safety improvement."
233,"Background Azithromycin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of its immunomodulatory actions. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Methods In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once per day by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or allocation to one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups). Patients were assigned via web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment and were twice as likely to be randomly assigned to usual care than to any of the active treatment groups. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment, but all others involved in the trial were masked to the outcome data during the trial. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. Findings Between April 7 and Nov 27, 2020, of 16 442 patients enrolled in the RECOVERY trial, 9433 (57%) were eligible and 7763 were included in the assessment of azithromycin. The mean age of these study participants was 65.3 years (SD 15.7) and approximately a third were women (2944 [38%] of 7763). 2582 patients were randomly allocated to receive azithromycin and 5181 patients were randomly allocated to usual care alone. Overall, 561 (22%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 1162 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.07; p=0.50). No significant difference was seen in duration of hospital stay (median 10 days [IQR 5 to >28] vs 11 days [5 to >28]) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.98-1.10; p=0.19). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, no significant difference was seen in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (risk ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.03; p=0.24). Interpretation In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, azithromycin did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes. Azithromycin use in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 should be restricted to patients in whom there is a clear antimicrobial indication. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

234,"An effective working relationship between physicians and nurses is enhanced by fostering positive perceptions and collaborative attitudes between the two professions. This brief paper examines the effect of an interprofessional simulation-based communication education program in enhancing medical and nursing students' perceptions of each other's profession and their attitudes toward nurse-physician collaboration. Pretest-Posttest design was conducted on 96 medical and nursing students who demonstrated the existence of professional stereotypes in the baseline data. This study showed that by promoting open communication, shared information and decision-making, mutual respect, and trust during the interprofessional simulation training, a positive transformation on the stereotypes and attitudes toward nurse-physician collaboration can be achieved.

235,"BackgroundRefugees and asylum seekers (RAS) in Germany need tailored and resource-oriented mental healthcare interventions. AimsTo evaluate the cost-effectiveness of group psychotherapy for RAS with moderate depressive symptoms. MethodThis is a post hoc cost-effectiveness analysis of Empowerment group psychotherapy that was embedded in a stratified stepped and collaborative care model (SCCM) from the multicentre randomised controlled MEHIRA trial. One hundred and forty-nine participants were randomly assigned to SCCM or treatment as usual (TAU) and underwent Empowerment (i.e. level 3 of the SCCM for adults) or TAU. Effects were measured with the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and quality adjusted life-years (QALY) post-intervention. Health service and intervention costs were measured. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated and net monetary benefit (NMB) regressions with 95% confidence intervals were performed. Cost-effectiveness was ascertained for different values of willingness to pay (WTP) using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for probable scenarios. Trial registration number: NCT03109028 on ClinicalTrials.gov. ResultsHealth service use costs were significantly lower for Empowerment than TAU after 1 year. Intervention costs were on average euro409.6. Empowerment led to a significant change in PHQ-9 scores but not QALY. Bootstrapped mean ICER indicated cost-effectiveness according to PHQ-9 and varied considerably for QALY in the base case. NMB for a unit reduction in PHQ-9 score at WTP of euro0 was euro354.3 (euro978.5 to -euro269.9). Results were confirmed for different scenarios and varying WTP thresholds. ConclusionsThe Empowerment intervention was cost-effective in refugees with moderate depressive symptoms regarding the clinical outcome and led to a reduction in direct healthcare consumption. Concerning QALYs, there was a lack of confidence that Empowerment differed from TAU."
236,"Scholars have begun to call for more formalized training of clinicians in structural competency as a way to address health inequities. Existing programs tend to focus on physicians. This continuing education program brought together a diverse group of academics and community partners to provide a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to structural competency training. The objective of this article is to outline the processes and procedures utilized to address structural determinants of health in a collaborative, community-based participatory research model. Study participants attended 12 weekly, two-hour seminars and completed electronic pre/post-knowledge surveys and a program evaluation form. The principal investigator and a graduate student reviewed open-ended survey responses using a grounded theory approach and summarized findings using narrative and descriptive statistics. Participants demonstrated an increased understanding of the distinction between structural competency and the social determinants of health. The program also led to successful collaborations on two research proposals. Even though structural determinants of health are distinct from the social determinants of health, many clinicians are unfamiliar with these distinctions. Working with an interdisciplinary team that includes community partnerships and individuals with diverse non-clinical areas of expertise can help healthcare professionals better understand these distinctions and how they influence patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary structural competency course can improve practical understanding of the structural determinants of health through an engaged community partnership platform."
237,"Introduction Despite recognition of the importance of patient engagement in research and knowledge translation, systematic approaches to engagement and co-ideation remain limited. Living labs are collaborative knowledge sharing systems that use multimethod, user-centred approaches that hold potential to catalyse these aims. However, their use in healthcare is limited, and no living lab has been developed in paediatric rehabilitation. In response to this gap and to propel innovative knowledge exchange, we propose a mixed methods study to co-develop a living lab prototype (ie, preliminary infrastructure with opportunity for scale up) in paediatric rehabilitation, with relevance to other healthcare contexts. Methods An exploratory sequential mixed methods study will be undertaken to determine research and knowledge exchange priorities and to inform the development of the living lab prototype. Stage 1: we will use a multipronged approach to sample 18-21 youth with developmental differences or rehabilitation needs, their youth siblings and parents/guardians from a provincial paediatric rehabilitation centre, to participate in qualitative and arts-based data collection. Data will provide insight into desirable features of the living lab. Stage 2: E-surveys to youth, siblings, parents/guardians and clinicians who receive or provide services at this same centre will expand on priorities and living lab features. Stage 3: integrated analysis will inform the living lab prototype development. Analysis Inductive thematic analysis using interpretive description, integrated analysis of visual data and descriptive and content analysis of e-survey data will be undertaken. Joint displays will facilitate data integration. Priorities will be identified using a modified rank-order method for each key living lab domain. Ethics and dissemination Institutional ethics and site approval have been granted. A parent advisory group and rehabilitation engineering partners will confer on data and inform the development of the living lab prototype. User engagement with the prototype will occur during an online or in-person event, and findings shared through non-technical research summaries, journal articles and academic presentations."
238,"To date, at least 2.41 billion people with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are in need of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation care through innovative technologies is the ideal candidate to reach all people with NCDs in need. To obtain these innovative solutions available in the public health system calls for a rigorous multidimensional evaluation that, with an articulated approach, is carried out through the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) methodology. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to illustrate how the Smart&TouchID (STID) model addresses the need to incorporate patients' evaluations into a multidimensional technology assessment framework by presenting a feasibility study of model application with regard to the rehabilitation experiences of people living with NCDs. After sketching out the STID model's vision and operational process, preliminary evidence on the experiences and attitudes of patients and citizens on rehabilitation care will be described and discussed, showing how they operate, enabling the co-design of technological solutions with a multi-stakeholder approach. Implications for public health are discussed including the view on the STID model as a tool to be integrated into public health governance strategies aimed at tuning the agenda-setting of innovation in rehabilitation care through a participatory methodology."
239,"Background Early identification of patients with mental health problems in need of highly specialised care could enhance the timely provision of appropriate care and improve the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies. Recent research on the development and psychometric evaluation of diagnosis-specific decision-support algorithms suggested that the treatment allocation of patients to highly specialised mental healthcare settings may be guided by a core set of transdiagnostic patient factors. Aims To develop and psychometrically evaluate a transdiagnostic decision tool to facilitate the uniform assessment of highly specialised mental healthcare need in heterogeneous patient groups. Method The Transdiagnostic Decision Tool was developed based on an analysis of transdiagnostic items of earlier developed diagnosis-specific decision tools. The Transdiagnostic Decision Tool was psychometrically evaluated in 505 patients with a somatic symptom disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. Feasibility, interrater reliability, convergent validity and criterion validity were assessed. In order to evaluate convergent validity, the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults (ICECAP-A) were administered. Results The six-item clinician-administered Transdiagnostic Decision Tool demonstrated excellent feasibility and acceptable interrater reliability. Spearman's rank correlations between the Transdiagnostic Decision Tool and ICECAP-A (-0.335), EQ-5D-5L index (-0.386) and EQ-5D-visual analogue scale (-0.348) supported convergent validity. The area under the curve was 0.81 and a cut-off value of >= 3 was found to represent the optimal cut-off value. Conclusions The Transdiagnostic Decision Tool demonstrated solid psychometric properties and showed promise as a measure for the early detection of patients in need of highly specialised mental healthcare."
240,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize the healthcare system, leading to enhance efficiency by automatizing routine tasks and decreasing health-related costs, broadening access to healthcare delivery, targeting more precisely patient needs, and assisting clinicians in their decision-making. For these benefits to materialize, governments and health authorities must regulate AI, and conduct appropriate health technology assessment (HTA). Many authors have highlighted that AI health technologies (AIHT) challenge traditional evaluation and regulatory processes. To inform and support HTA organizations and regulators in adapting their processes to AIHTs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the challenges posed by AIHTs in HTA and health regulation. Our research question was: What makes artificial intelligence exceptional in HTA? The current body of literature appears to portray AIHTs as being exceptional to HTA. This exceptionalism is expressed along 5 dimensions: 1) AIHT's distinctive features; 2) their systemic impacts on health care and the health sector; 3) the increased expectations towards AI in health; 4) the new ethical, social and legal challenges that arise from deploying AI in the health sector; and 5) the new evaluative constraints that AI poses to HTA. Thus, AIHTs are perceived as exceptional because of their technological characteristics and potential impacts on society at large. As AI implementation by governments and health organizations carries risks of generating new, and amplifying existing, challenges, there are strong arguments for taking into consideration the exceptional aspects of AIHTs, especially as their impacts on the healthcare system will be far greater than that of drugs and medical devices. As AIHTs begin to be increasingly introduced into the health care sector, there is a window of opportunity for HTA agencies and scholars to consider AIHTs' exceptionalism and to work towards only deploying clinically, economically, socially acceptable AIHTs in the health care system."
241,"ObjectiveTo identify ethical values guiding decision making in resetting non-COVID-19 paediatric surgery and maternity services in the National Health Service (NHS).DesignA rapid review of academic and grey literature sources from 29 April to 31 December 2020, covering non-urgent, non-COVID-19 healthcare. Sources were thematically synthesised against an adapted version of the UK Government's Pandemic Flu Ethical Framework to identify underpinning ethical principles. The strength of normative engagement and the quality of the sources were also assessed.SettingNHS maternity and paediatric surgery services in England.ResultsSearches conducted 8 September-12 October 2020, and updated in March 2021, identified 48 sources meeting the inclusion criteria. Themes that arose include: staff safety; collaborative working - including mutual dependencies across the healthcare system; reciprocity; and inclusivity in service recovery, for example, by addressing inequalities in service access. Embedded in the theme of staff and patient safety is embracing new ways of working, such as the rapid roll out of telemedicine. On assessment, many sources did not explicitly consider how ethical principles might be applied or balanced against one another. Weaknesses in the policy sources included a lack of public and user involvement and the absence of monitoring and evaluation criteria.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that relationality is a prominent ethical principle informing resetting NHS non-COVID-19 paediatric surgery and maternity services. Sources explicitly highlight the ethical importance of seeking to minimise disruption to caring and dependent relationships, while simultaneously attending to public safety. Engagement with ethical principles was ethics-lite, with sources mentioning principles in passing rather than explicitly applying them. This leaves decision makers and healthcare professionals without an operationalisable ethical framework to apply to difficult reset decisions and risks inconsistencies in decision making. We recommend further research to confirm or refine the usefulness of the reset phase ethical framework developed through our analysis."
242,"Background Doxycycline is often used for treating COVID-19 respiratory symptoms in the community despite an absence of evidence from clinical trials to support its use. We aimed to assess the efficacy of doxycycline to treat suspected COVID-19 in the community among people at high risk of adverse outcomes. Methods We did a national, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in older people (PRINCIPLE) across primary care centres in the UK. We included people aged 65 years or older, or 50 years or older with comorbidities (weakened immune system, heart disease, hypertension, asthma or lung disease, diabetes, mild hepatic impairment, stroke or neurological problem, and self-reported obesity or body-mass index of 35 kg/m(2) or greater), who had been unwell (for <= 14 days) with suspected COVID-19 or a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Participants were randomly assigned using response adaptive randomisation to usual care only, usual care plus oral doxycycline (200 mg on day 1, then 100 mg once daily for the following 6 days), or usual care plus other interventions. The interventions reported in this manuscript are usual care plus doxycycline and usual care only; evaluations of other interventions in this platform trial are ongoing. The coprimary endpoints were time to first self-reported recovery, and hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19, both measured over 28 days from randomisation and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ISRCTN, 86534580. Findings The trial opened on April 2, 2020. Randomisation to doxycycline began on July 24, 2020, and was stopped on Dec 14, 2020, because the prespecified futility criterion was met; 2689 participants were enrolled and randomised between these dates. Of these, 2508 (93.3%) participants contributed follow-up data and were included in the primary analysis: 780 (31.1%) in the usual care plus doxycycline group, 948 in the usual care only group (37.8%), and 780 (31.1%) in the usual care plus other interventions group. Among the 1792 participants randomly assigned to the usual care plus doxycycline and usual care only groups, the mean age was 61.1 years (SD 7.9); 999 (55.7%) participants were female and 790 (44.1%) were male. In the primary analysis model, there was little evidence of difference in median time to first self-reported recovery between the usual care plus doxycycline group and the usual care only group (9.6 [95% Bayesian Credible Interval [BCI] 8.3 to 11.0] days vs 10.1 [8.7 to 11.7] days, hazard ratio 1.04 [95% BCI 0.93 to 1.17]). The estimated benefit in median time to first self-reported recovery was 0.5 days [95% BCI -0.99 to 2.04] and the probability of a clinically meaningful benefit (defined as >= 1.5 days) was 0.10. Hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19 occurred in 41 (crude percentage 5.3%) participants in the usual care plus doxycycline group and 43 (4.5%) in the usual care only group (estimated absolute percentage difference -0.5% [95% BCI -2.6 to 1.4]); there were five deaths (0.6%) in the usual care plus doxycycline group and two (0.2%) in the usual care only group. Interpretation In patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community in the UK, who were at high risk of adverse outcomes, treatment with doxycycline was not associated with clinically meaningful reductions in time to recovery or hospital admissions or deaths related to COVID-19, and should not be used as a routine treatment for COVID-19.

243,"Background: A redistribution of tasks between specialized nurses and primary care physicians, i.e., models of advanced nursing practice, has the potential to improve the treatment and care of the growing number of people with dementia (PwD). Especially in rural areas with limited access to primary care physicians and specialists, these models might improve PwD's quality of life and well-being. However, such care models are not available in Germany in regular healthcare. This study examines the acceptance, safety, efficacy, and health economic efficiency of an advanced nursing practice model for PwD in the primary care setting in Germany. Methods: InDePendent is a two-arm, multi-center, cluster-randomized controlled intervention study. Inclusion criteria are age >= 70 years, cognitively impaired (DemTect <= 8) or formally diagnosed with dementia, and living in the own home. Patients will be recruited by general practitioners or specialists. Randomization is carried out at the physicians' level in a ratio of 1:2 (intervention vs. waiting-control group). After study inclusion, all participants will receive a baseline assessment and a follow-up assessment after 6 months. Patients of the intervention group will receive advanced dementia care management for 6 months, carried out by specialized nurses, who will conduct certain tasks, usually carried out by primary care physicians. This includes a standardized assessment of the patients' unmet needs, the generation and implementation of an individualized care plan to address the patients' needs in close coordination with the GP. PwD in the waiting-control group will receive routine care for 6 months and subsequently become part of the intervention group. The primary outcome is the number of unmet needs after 6 months measured by the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE). The primary analysis after 6 months is carried out using multilevel models and will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, caregiver burden, acceptance, and cost-effectiveness. In total, n=465 participants are needed to assess significant differences in the number of unmet needs between the intervention and control groups. Discussion: The study will provide evidence about the acceptance, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of an innovative interprofessional concept based on advanced nursing care. Results will contribute to the implementation of such models in the German healthcare system. The goal is to improve the current treatment and care situation for PwD and their caregivers and to expand nursing roles."
244,"IntroductionThe National Health Service Insight Prioritisation Programme was established to accelerate the implementation and evaluation of innovation that supports post-pandemic working. Supporting this, the Academic Health Science Network and National Institute for Health and Care Research Applied Research Collaboration in South London are testing and evaluating the implementation and scale-up of a type 2 diabetes (T2D) intervention.T2D is estimated to be three times more prevalent in UK African and Caribbean communities than in white Europeans. To tackle ethnic inequities in T2D healthcare access, an evidence-based, culturally tailored self-management and education programme for African and Caribbean adults (Healthy Eating & Active Lifestyles for Diabetes, HEAL-D) has been codeveloped with people with lived experience. Initially a face-to-face programme, HEAL-D pivoted to virtual delivery in response to COVID-19.The purpose of this study is to explore the (1) feasibility and acceptability of a virtual delivery model for HEAL-D in south London and (2) factors affecting its scale-up across other areas in England. Methods and analysisThe study will have two strands: (1) mixed-methods prospective evaluation of HEAL-D virtual delivery in south London using routinely collected service-level data, service delivery staff and service user interviews and observations; and (2) prospective qualitative study of the scale-up of this virtual delivery comprising interviews and focus groups with members of the public, and diabetes services commissioners and providers across England. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis. Quantitative analysis will use descriptive statistics and reporting summary tables and figures. The study will be grounded in well-established implementation frameworks and service user involvement. Ethics and dissemination'Minimal Risk Registration' ethical clearance was granted by King's College London's Research Ethics Office (ref: MRA-21/22-28498). Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and summaries provided to the study funders and participants."
245,"Purpose Considering several patients screened due to COVID-19 pandemic, computer-aided detection has strong potential in assisting clinical workflow efficiency and reducing the incidence of infections among radiologists and healthcare providers. Since many confirmed COVID-19 cases present radiological findings of pneumonia, radiologic examinations can be useful for fast detection. Therefore, chest radiography can be used to fast screen COVID-19 during the patient triage, thereby determining the priority of patient's care to help saturated medical facilities in a pandemic situation. Methods In this paper, we propose a new learning scheme called self-supervised transfer learning for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images. We compared six self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (Cross, BYOL, SimSiam, SimCLR, PIRL-jigsaw, and PIRL-rotation) with the proposed method. Additionally, we compared six pretrained DCNNs (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, CheXNet, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3) with the proposed method. We provide quantitative evaluation on the largest open COVID-19 CXR dataset and qualitative results for visual inspection. Results Our method achieved a harmonic mean (HM) score of 0.985, AUC of 0.999, and four-class accuracy of 0.953. We also used the visualization technique Grad-CAM++ to generate visual explanations of different classes of CXR images with the proposed method to increase the interpretability. Conclusions Our method shows that the knowledge learned from natural images using transfer learning is beneficial for SSL of the CXR images and boosts the performance of representation learning for COVID-19 detection. Our method promises to reduce the incidence of infections among radiologists and healthcare providers."
246,"Introduction: The prevalence of cancer is increasing among Indigenous peoples in Canada. To enhance quality of life of those Indigenous people affected by cancer, their decision-making experiences must be understood. This article presents the findings of a qualitative study exploring the treatment decision-making practices among Indigenous peoples with cancer in rural and remote Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. Methods: This study employed a qualitative narrative-based approach using the Indigenous research method of storytelling. Seventeen Indigenous participants (14 women, three men) with various forms of cancer were interviewed. Open-ended questions were used that were designed to understand participants' decision-making processing regarding their cancer treatment. Results: Keeping with Indigenous methodology, the interview transcripts were analysed by a narrative method, with the intent that the data would be presented in story format. Eight vignettes relating to decision making were created: being strong for family; family support; strength and independence; denial and not wanting to know; fear-based decision making; finding the blessing; the spiritual journey; and traditional medicine and doctors. Participants were involved in validating the analysis to ensure that data were accurately interpreted. Conclusion: The vignettes demonstrate the similarities and differences among Indigenous people with cancer from other countries. A primary feature is that family members play a central role in participants' cancer treatment decisions. While some participants embraced and relied upon traditional medicines, others were supported by the providers of Western health care. A healthcare system that provides access to both traditional and Western medicine can be essential to culturally safe, high-quality cancer care for Indigenous peoples."
247,"RationaleEndovascular treatment has been shown to restore blood flow effectively. Second-generation medical devices such as stent retrievers are now showing overwhelming efficacy in clinical trials, particularly in conjunction with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Aims and DesignThis statistical analysis plan utilizing a novel, sequential approach describes a prospective, individual patient data analysis of endovascular therapy in conjunction with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator agreed upon by the Thrombectomy and Tissue Plasminogen Activator Collaborative Group. Study OutcomesThis protocol will specify the primary outcome for efficacy, as favorable' outcome defined by the ordinal distribution of the modified Rankin Scale measured at three-months poststroke, but with modified Rankin Scales 5 and 6 collapsed into a single category. The primary analysis will aim to answer the questions: what is the treatment effect of endovascular therapy with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator compared to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone on full scale modified Rankin Scale at 3 months?' and to what extent do key patient characteristics influence the treatment effect of endovascular therapy?'. Key secondary outcomes include effect of endovascular therapy on death within 90 days; analyses of modified Rankin Scale using dichotomized methods; and effects of endovascular therapy on symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Several secondary analyses will be considered as well as expanding patient cohorts to intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-ineligible patients, should data allow. DiscussionThis collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomized trials of endovascular therapy vs. control in conjunction with intravenous thrombolysis will demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of endovascular therapy with intravenous thrombolysis as a concomitant medication."
248,"Objectives: To analyse the research activity and publication output of surgical trainee research collaboratives in the UK. Setting: Surgical trainee research collaboratives in the UK. Participants: A total of 24 collaboratives were included in this study from 33 identified organisations. We excluded one group that focused purely on systematic review of the literature and eight groups for which we could not identify suitable data sources (website or trainee committee contact). Primary and secondary outcome: Primary datapoints were identified for each collaborative including surgical subspeciality, numbers and types of projects. For published articles, secondary outcomes including study population size, journal impact factor, number of citations and evidence level were collected. Results: A total of 24 collaboratives met our inclusion criteria with a portfolio of 80 projects. The project types included audit (46%), randomised clinical trial (16%), surveys (16%), cohort studies (10%), systematic reviews (2.5%) and other or unidentifiable (9.5%). A total of 35 publications were identified of which just over half (54%) were original research articles. The median size of studied population was 540 patients with a range from 108 to 3138. The published works provided a varied compilation of evidence levels ranging from 1b (individual RCT) to 5 (expert opinion) with a median level of 2b (individual cohort study). The West Midlands Research Collaborative had the highest number of publications (13), citations (130) and h-index (5). Conclusions: The experience of UK-based trainee research collaboratives provides useful insights for trainees and policymakers in global healthcare systems on the value and feasibility of trainee-driven high quality surgical research."
249,"The legal shift to an opt-out system of consent for deceased organ donation is now official in England, Wales and Scotland. While it is commendable that national governments across the United Kingdom have publicly signalled their serious engagement with organ donation, it remains questionable that opt-out policy can in and of itself solve the public health issue of organ shortage. Opt-out policy risks becoming a futile solution if it fails to attend to key factors in clinical practice. Thus, this article provides critical insights and practical considerations in order to work towards increasing the availability of organs for transplantation: 1) organ donation specialists on their own are not enough, a collaborative hospital culture of donation is also needed; 2) investment in innovative perfusion technologies is fundamental to increase both the quantity and quality of organs utilised for transplants; and 3) opt-out does not solve the enduring problem of consent or authorization for donation, rather than hoping that opt-out will shift the societal culture of donation and make donation the default choice, it is necessary to acknowledge that families' authorization remains essential and their emotional experience can neither be minimized nor excluded altogether. Importantly, consent rates are not the only factor to account for overall deceased donation rates. The organ shortage cannot be solely attributed to a matter of negative public attitudes reversible by law. Doing that does a disservice to the public and diverts strategic attention and resources from fostering the organizational and technological enablers of organ donation in clinical practice.

250,"Silicon photonics provides wafer-scale fabrication of densely integrated photonic circuits that are enabling breakthrough applications in datacom, artificial intelligence, and healthcare. The sub-micrometer mode size of silicon waveguides makes efficient coupling to conventional single mode fibers extremely challenging. While advanced surface grating couplers can achieve sub-decibel coupling efficiencies, their operation relies on diffraction phenomena, which intrinsically limit the operational bandwidth. Here a novel type of surface coupler is experimentally demonstrated that overcomes the efficiency-bandwidth limitation of conventional diffraction gratings by harnessing zero-order radiation from a subwavelength metamaterial waveguide to a tilted silicon prism. The device achieves a coupling efficiency above 80% to an SMF-28 fiber in a record 1-dB bandwidth beyond 90 nm, opening new venues for highly efficient broadband fiber-to-chip surface coupling in silicon photonics."
251,"Background Most studies of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 focus on circulating antibody, giving limited insights into mucosal defences that prevent viral replication and onward transmission. We studied nasal and plasma antibody responses one year after hospitalisation for COVID-19, including a period when SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was introduced.Methods In this follow up study, plasma and nasosorption samples were prospectively collected from 446 adults hospitalised for COVID-19 between February 2020 and March 2021 via the ISARIC4C and PHOSP-COVID consortia. IgA and IgG responses to NP and S of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Delta and Omicron (BA.1) variants were measured by electrochemiluminescence and compared with plasma neutralisation data.Findings Strong and consistent nasal anti-NP and anti-S IgA responses were demonstrated, which remained elevated for nine months (p < 0.0001). Nasal and plasma anti-S IgG remained elevated for at least 12 months (p < 0.0001) with plasma neutralising titres that were raised against all variants compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Of 323 with complete data, 307 were vaccinated between 6 and 12 months; coinciding with rises in nasal and plasma IgA and IgG anti-S titres for all SARS-CoV-2 variants, although the change in nasal IgA was minimal (1.46-fold change after 10 months, p = 0.011) and the median remained below the positive threshold determined by pre-pandemic controls. Samples 12 months after admission showed no association between nasal IgA and plasma IgG anti-S responses (R = 0.05, p = 0.18), indicating that nasal IgA responses are distinct from those in plasma and minimally boosted by vaccination. Interpretation The decline in nasal IgA responses 9 months after infection and minimal impact of subsequent vaccination may explain the lack of long-lasting nasal defence against reinfection and the limited effects of vaccination on transmission. These findings highlight the need to develop vaccines that enhance nasal immunity. Funding This study has been supported by ISARIC4C and PHOSP-COVID consortia.

252,"Forms of collaborative knowledge production, such as community-academic partnerships (CAP), have been increasingly used in health care. However, instructions on how to deliver such processes are lacking. We aim to identify practice ingredients for one element within a CAP, a 6-month co-design process, during which 26 community- and 13 research-partners collaboratively designed an intervention programme for children whose parent have a mental illness. Using 22 published facilitating and hindering factors for CAP as the analytical framework, eight community-partners reflected on the activities which took place during the co-design process. From a qualitative content analysis of the data, we distilled essential practices for each CAP factor. Ten community- and eight research-partners revised the results and co-authored this article. We identified 36 practices across the 22 CAP facilitating or hindering factors. Most practices address more than one factor. Many practices relate to workshop design, facilitation methods, and relationship building. Most practices were identified for facilitating 'trust among partners', 'shared visions, goals and/or missions', 'effective/frequent communication', and 'well-structured meetings'. Fewer practices were observed for 'effective conflict resolution', 'positive community impact' and for avoiding 'excessive funding pressure/control struggles' and 'high burden of activities'. Co-designing a programme for mental healthcare is a challenging process that requires skills in process management and communication. We provide practice steps for delivering co-design activities. However, practitioners may have to adapt them to different cultural contexts. Further research is needed to analyse whether co-writing with community-partners results in a better research output and benefits for participants."
253,"Sensor systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) make it possible to continuously monitor people, gathering information without any extra effort from them. Thus, the IoT can be very helpful in the context of early disease detection, which can improve peoples' quality of life by applying the right treatment and measures at an early stage. This paper presents a new use of IoT sensor systemswe present a novel three-door smart cupboard that can measure the memory of a user, aiming at detecting potential memory losses. The smart cupboard has three sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi, whose aim is to detect which doors are opened. Inside of the Raspberry Pi, a Python script detects the openings of the doors, and classifies the events between attempts of finding something without success and the events of actually finding it, in order to measure the user's memory concerning the objects' locations (among the three compartments of the smart cupboard). The smart cupboard was assessed with 23 different users in a controlled environment. This smart cupboard was powered by an external battery. The memory assessments of the smart cupboard were compared with a validated test of memory assessment about face-name associations and a self-reported test about self-perceived memory. We found a significant correlation between the smart cupboard results and both memory measurement methods. Thus, we conclude that the proposed novel smart cupboard successfully measured memory."
254,"Background Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Health Service (NHS) recommended that appropriate patients anticoagulated with warfarin should be switched to direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), requiring less frequent blood testing. Subsequently, a national safety alert was issued regarding patients being inappropriately coprescribed two anticoagulants following a medication change and associated monitoring. Objective To describe which people were switched from warfarin to DOACs; identify potentially unsafe coprescribing of anticoagulants; and assess whether abnormal clotting results have become more frequent during the pandemic. Methods With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a cohort study using routine clinical data from 24 million NHS patients in England. Results 20 000 of 164 000 warfarin patients (12.2%) switched to DOACs between March and May 2020, most commonly to edoxaban and apixaban. Factors associated with switching included: older age, recent renal function test, higher number of recent INR tests recorded, atrial fibrillation diagnosis and care home residency. There was a sharp rise in coprescribing of warfarin and DOACs from typically 50-100 per month to 246 in April 2020, 0.06% of all people receiving a DOAC or warfarin. International normalised ratio (INR) testing fell by 14% to 506.8 patients tested per 1000 warfarin patients each month. We observed a very small increase in elevated INRs (n=470) during April compared with January (n=420). Conclusions Increased switching of anticoagulants from warfarin to DOACs was observed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in England following national guidance. There was a small but substantial number of people coprescribed warfarin and DOACs during this period. Despite a national safety alert on the issue, a widespread rise in elevated INR test results was not found. Primary care has responded rapidly to changes in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic."
255,"BackgroundMethods to accurately predict the risk of in-hospital mortality are important for applications including quality assessment of healthcare institutions and research.ObjectiveTo update and validate the Kaiser Permanente inpatient risk adjustment methodology (KP method) to predict in-hospital mortality, using open-source tools to measure comorbidity and diagnosis groups, and removing troponin which is difficult to standardize across modern clinical assays.DesignRetrospective cohort study using electronic health record data from GEMINI. GEMINI is a research collaborative that collects administrative and clinical data from hospital information systems.ParticipantsAdult general medicine inpatients at 28 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between April 2010 and December 2022.Main MeasuresThe outcome was in-hospital mortality, modeled by diagnosis group using 56 logistic regressions. We compared models with and without troponin as an input to the laboratory-based acute physiology score. We fit and validated the updated method using internal-external cross-validation at 28 hospitals from April 2015 to December 2022.Key ResultsIn 938,103 hospitalizations with 7.2% in-hospital mortality, the updated KP method accurately predicted the risk of mortality. The c-statistic at the median hospital was 0.866 (see Fig. 3) (25th-75th 0.848-0.876, range 0.816-0.927) and calibration was strong for nearly all patients at all hospitals. The 95th percentile absolute difference between predicted and observed probabilities was 0.038 at the median hospital (25th-75th 0.024-0.057, range 0.006-0.118). Model performance was very similar with and without troponin in a subset of 7 hospitals, and performance was similar with and without troponin for patients hospitalized for heart failure and acute myocardial infarction.ConclusionsAn update to the KP method accurately predicted in-hospital mortality for general medicine inpatients in 28 hospitals in Ontario, Canada. This updated method can be implemented in a wider range of settings using common open-source tools."
256,"Objective: Addressing the quality gap in ICU-based palliative care is limited by uncertainty about acceptable models of collaborative specialist and generalist care. Therefore, we characterized the attitudes of physicians and nurses about palliative care delivery in an ICU environment. Design: Mixed-methods study. Setting: Medical and surgical ICUs at three large academic hospitals. Participants: Three hundred three nurses, intensivists, and advanced practice providers. Measurements and Main Results: Clinicians completed written surveys that assessed attitudes about specialist palliative care presence and integration into the ICU setting, as well as acceptability of 23 published palliative care prompts (triggers) for specialist consultation. Most (n = 225; 75%) reported that palliative care consultation was underutilized. Prompting consideration of eligibility for specialist consultation by electronic health record searches for triggers was most preferred (n = 123; 41%); only 17 of them (6%) felt current processes were adequate. The most acceptable specialist triggers were metastatic malignancy, unrealistic goals of care, end of life decision making, and persistent organ failure. Advanced age, length of stay, and duration of life support were the least acceptable. Screening led by either specialists or ICU teams was equally preferred. Central themes derived from qualitative analysis of 65 written responses to open-ended items included concerns about the roles of physicians and nurses, implementation, and impact on ICU teamfamily relationships. Conclusions: Integration of palliative care specialists in the ICU is broadly acceptable and desired. However, the most commonly used current triggers for prompting specialist consultation were among the least well accepted, while more favorable triggers are difficult to abstract from electronic health record systems. There is also disagreement about the role of ICU nurses in palliative care delivery. These findings provide important guidance to the development of collaborative care models for the ICU setting."
257,"Background: Hypertension control is poor everywhere, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). An effective response requires understanding factors acting at each stage on the patients' pathway through the health system from entry or first contact with the health system, through to treatment initiation and follow up. This systematic review aimed to identify barriers to and facilitators of hypertension control along this pathway and, respectively, ways to overcome or strengthen them. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL Plus, and Africa-Wide Information (1980-April 2019) were searched for studies of hypertensive adults in LMICs reporting details of at least 2 adequately described health system contacts. Data were extracted and analysed by 2 reviewers. Themes were developed using NVivo in patient-related (sociodemographic, knowledge and health beliefs, health status and co-morbidities, trade-offs), social (social relationships and traditions) and health system domains (resources and processes). Results are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: From 2584 identified records, 30 were included in the narrative synthesis. At entry, 'health systems resources and processes' and 'knowledge and beliefs about hypertension' dominated while 'social relations and traditions' and 'comorbidities' assume greater importance subsequently, with patients making 'trade-offs' with family priorities during follow up. Socio-demographic factors play a role, but to a lesser extent than other factors. Context matters. Conclusion: Understanding the changing barriers to hypertension control along the patient journey is necessary to develop a comprehensive and efficient response to this persisting problem.

258,"Introduction Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a major respiratory complication caused by severe obesity, being associated with significant morbidity, negative impacts on quality of life and reduced survival if not treated appropriately. Positive airway pressure therapy is the first-line treatment for OHS although the optimal modality remains unclear. The goal of this study is to identify the efficacy of home bilevel positive airway pressure therapy by comparison to continuous positive airway pressure therapy and determine the best strategy for patients with OHS. Methods and analysis This study will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 statement. We will search the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and CINAHL. Ongoing studies will be identified through the ClinicalTrials. gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal. Grey literature will be recognised through Google Scholar and other search engines. Only randomised controlled trials meeting the eligibility criteria will be included. The risk of bias of the included studies will be evaluated through the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. RevMan V. 5.3.5 software will be used for data analysis. The Q statistic and I-2 index will be used for investigating heterogeneity, and subgroup analysis or sensitivity analysis will be used to explore the source of heterogeneity. In addition, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system will be used to inspect the quality of evidence. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required because this study contains no primary data collected from humans. This systematic review and meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication."
259,"Background Depressive disorders are associated with a high burden of disease. However, due to the burden posed by the disease on not only the sufferers, but also on their relatives, there is an ongoing debate about which costs to include and, hence, which perspective should be applied. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to examine whether the change between healthcare payer and societal perspective leads to different conclusions of cost-utility analyses in the case of depression. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted to identify economic evaluations of interventions in depression, launched on Medline and the Cost-Effectiveness Registry of the Tufts University using a ten-year time horizon (2008-2018). In a two-stepped screening process, cost-utility studies were selected by means of specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, relevant findings was extracted and, if not fully stated, calculated by the authors of this work. Results Overall, 53 articles with 92 complete economic evaluations, reporting costs from healthcare payer/provider and societal perspective, were identified. More precisely, 22 estimations (24%) changed their results regarding the cost-effectiveness quadrant when the societal perspective was included. Furthermore, 5% of the ICURs resulted in cost-effectiveness regarding the chosen threshold (2% of them became dominant) when societal costs were included. However, another four estimations (4%) showed the opposite result: these interventions were no longer cost-effective after the inclusion of societal costs. Conclusions Summarising the disparities in results and applied methods, the results show that societal costs might alter the conclusions in cost-utility analyses. Hence, the relevance of the perspectives chosen should be taken into account when carrying out an economic evaluation. This systematic review demonstrates that the results of economic evaluations can be affected by different methods available for estimating non-healthcare costs."
260,"The landscape of mental health recovery is changing; there have been calls for a shift from the clinical expertise being the dominant voice within mental healthcare towards a more personalised and collaborative service that supports those in need of mental healthcare to define what recovery is for the individual. Within this new recovery movement, there has been a recognition of the importance of the social environment in which individuals are situated and the relationship of this to mental health and wellbeing. Included in this is the importance of an individual's role within society and the ways in which knowledge, such as experts by experience, can hold an important value. The argument then, is that social connectedness forms part of the recovery journey and that relationships can help us develop or re-connect with who we are in powerful ways. Such a view has only been strengthened by the recent and ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Within the UK, discussions of the importance of our wellbeing have become commonplace within the context of restricted social contact. With this heightened awareness of how the social contributes to wellbeing, it is important to consider the environments in which those in receipt of mental healthcare are situated. One of which is institutionalised care, where it is commonplace to restrict social contact. For example, by virtue of being within a locked environment, individuals' freedom of movement is often non-existent and thus contacts with those not residing or working within the institution is restricted. While such restrictions may be deemed necessary to protect the individual's mental health, such environments can be unintentionally toxic. Data are presented from an ethnography that was conducted within an inpatient forensic mental health hospital in the UK to highlight the problematic social environment which some individuals experience. Key interpersonal issues are presented, such as, trust, racism, the threat of physical violence and bullying that was experienced by staff and residents at the hospital. Consideration is given to the coping strategies enacted by residents and the pathologising of such behaviour. The consequences on interpersonal wellbeing are explored."
261,"People are increasingly involved in the self-management of their own health, including chronic conditions. With technology advances, the choice of self-management practices, tools, and technologies has never been greater. The studies reported here investigated the information seeking practices of two different chronic health populations in their quest to manage their health conditions. Migraine and diabetes patients and clinicians in the UK and the US were interviewed about their information needs and practices, and representative online communities were explored to inform a qualitative study. We found that people with either chronic condition require personally relevant information and use a broad and varied set of practices and tools to make sense of their specific symptoms, triggers, and treatments. Participants sought out different types of information from varied sources about themselves, their medical condition, and their peers' experiences of the same chronic condition. People with diabetes and migraine expended great effort to validate their personal experiences of their condition and determine whether these experiences were 'normal'. Based on these findings, we discuss the need for future personal health technologies that support people in engaging in meaningful and personalised data collection, information seeking, and information sharing with peers in flexible ways that enable them to better understand their own condition."
262,"Background The antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 hospitalized patients remains controversial. Objectives To estimate the effect of remdesivir in blocking viral replication. Methods We analysed nasopharyngeal normalized viral loads from 665 hospitalized patients included in the DisCoVeRy trial (NCT 04315948; EudraCT 2020-000936-23), randomized to either standard of care (SoC) or SoC + remdesivir. We used a mathematical model to reconstruct viral kinetic profiles and estimate the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in blocking viral replication. Additional analyses were conducted stratified on time of treatment initiation (<= 7 or >7 days since symptom onset) or viral load at randomization (< or >= 3.5 log(10) copies/10(4) cells). Results In our model, remdesivir reduced viral production by infected cells by 2-fold on average (95% CI: 1.5-3.2-fold). Model-based simulations predict that remdesivir reduced time to viral clearance by 0.7 days compared with SoC, with large inter-individual variabilities (IQR: 0.0-1.3 days). Remdesivir had a larger impact in patients with high viral load at randomization, reducing viral production by 5-fold on average (95% CI: 2.8-25-fold) and the median time to viral clearance by 2.4 days (IQR: 0.9-4.5 days). Conclusions Remdesivir halved viral production, leading to a median reduction of 0.7 days in the time to viral clearance compared with SoC. The efficacy was larger in patients with high viral load at randomization."
263,"Introduction Controlling risk factors with regular exercise is effective and cost-effective for the primary prevention of ischaemic stroke. As a traditional Chinese form of exercise, Tai Chi might be beneficial in decreasing ischaemic stroke, but the evidence remains insufficient. We hypothesise that elderly community adults with risk factors for ischaemic stroke will decrease their ischaemic stroke risk by improving cerebral haemodynamic parameters, cardiopulmonary function, motor function, plasma risk indices, physical parameters or psychological outcomes after receiving 12weeks of regular Tai Chi training compared with those who maintained their original physical activities. Therefore, we designed a randomised controlled trial that will systematically evaluate the protective effects of Tai Chi exercise on ischaemic stroke risk in an elderly community population with risk factors for ischaemic stroke. Methods and analysis A total of 170 eligible participants were randomly allocated into either the Tai Chi training group or the usual physical activity group. This paper reports on the design, intervention development and baseline characteristics of the participants. There were no significant differences between comparison groups in demographic characteristics or the baseline data of primary or secondary outcomes. Participants in the Tai Chi training group will receive 12weeks of Tai Chi training with a frequency of 5days/week and 60min/day, while those in the usual physical activities group will maintain their original activities. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at the 12-week and 24-week follow-ups. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of The Affiliated People's Hospital of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (number 2013-020-02). The findings of this study will be communicated to healthcare professionals, participants and the public through peer-reviewed publications or scientific conferences. Trial registration number ChiCTR-TRC-13003601; Pre-results."
264,"Objectives The Severe Respiratory Insufficiency (SRI) questionnaire is the best assessment tool for health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). This study aimed to translate the SRI Questionnaire into Chinese and to validate it. Design Prospective validation study. Setting and participants A total of 149 participants with chronic hypercapnic COPD receiving NIPPV completed the study. Methods The SRI questionnaire was translated into Chinese using translation and back-translation. Reliability was gauged using Cronbach's a coefficient. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to assess construct validity. Content validity was confirmed by evaluating the relationship between the score of each item and the total score of the relevant subscale. Results Cronbach's a coefficients for each subscale and summary scale were above 0.7. Using EFA, one factor was extracted from the anxiety and summary scales and two factors were extracted from the remaining six subscales. Based on the EFA results, subsequent CFA revealed a good model fit for each subscale, but the extracted factors of each subscale were correlated. Content validity was confirmed by the good relationship between the score of each item and the total score of the relevant subscale. Conclusion The Chinese version of the SRI questionnaire is valid and reliable for patients with chronic hypercapnic COPD receiving NIPPV in China."
265,"Since the 2010s, the demand for healthcare models has exceeded the prevailing resources available due to the rapid increase in the aging population in China. However, a significant gap in development of biomedical materials remains, especially between China and the western developed countries. Collagen is the major protein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and has been extensively applied in medical fields. Collagen-based biomaterials (CBBs) are used to prepare dressings and dermal substitutes, surgical sutures, plasma substitutes, tissue-engineered scaffolds, and drug delivery systems; this is attributed to their exceptional biocompatibility, biodegradability, hypoimmunogenicity, and coordination between collagen hosts and tissues. This review provides thorough strides in CBB structures, crosslinking and forming technologies, and real-world applications. First, the natural origin and specific structures of animal-derived collagen and non-animal-derived collagen are introduced and compared. Second, crosslinking methods and forming technologies of CBBs across the board are discussed. Third, several examples are considered to demonstrate the practical biomedical use of CBBs and highlight cautionary notes. Finally, the underlying development directions of CBBs from an interdisciplinary perspective are outlined. This review aims to provide comprehensive mechanisms by which collagen can be uniquely and practically used as advanced biomaterial, hence providing options for augmenting its development in China."
266,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare activity. The NHS stopped non-urgent work in March 2020, later recommending services be restored to near-normal levels before winter where possible. Aim To describe the volume and variation of coded clinical activity in general practice, taking respiratory disease and laboratory procedures as examples. Design and setting Working on behalf of NHS England, a cohort study was conducted of 23.8 million patient records in general practice, in situ using OpenSAFELY. Method Activity using Clinical Terms Version 3 codes and keyword searches from January 2019 to September 2020 are described. Results Activity recorded in general practice declined during the pandemic, but largely recovered by September. There was a large drop in coded activity for laboratory tests, with broad recovery to pre-pandemic levels by September. One exception was the international normalised ratio test, with a smaller reduction (median tests per 1000 patients in 2020: February 8.0; April 6.2; September 6.9). The pattern of recording for respiratory symptoms was less affected, following an expected seasonal pattern and classified as 'no change'. Respiratory infections exhibited a sustained drop, not returning to pre-pandemic levels by September. Asthma reviews experienced a small drop but recovered, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reviews remained below baseline. Conclusion An open-source software framework was delivered to describe trends and variation in clinical activity across an unprecedented scale of primary care data. The COVD-19 pandemic led to a substantial change in healthcare activity. Most laboratory tests showed substantial reduction, largely recovering to near-normal levels by September, with some important tests less affected and recording of respiratory disease codes was mixed."
267,"Wound healing is an essential and complex biological process. Research into its mechanism and factors that influence its effectiveness has led to better treatments. Changes in the microenvironment are demonstrated to affect wound healing. Cell polarity is a significant microenvironment-related parameter that is associated with many physiological and pathological activities. However, dynamic changes in polarity during wound healing have not been investigated. Monitoring cell polarity during wound healing may open up a new avenue for developing better treatments. Here, a method is developed to monitor cell polarity that involved taking advantage of the fascinating optical properties and biocompatibility of carbon dots (CDs). Specifically, near-infrared (NIR) polarity-sensitive N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (PPh-CDs) are successfully prepared, which exhibit high sensitivity to polarity, with 509-fold stronger fluorescence in dioxane than in water. The PPh-CDs are successfully applied to monitor the changes of lysosomal polarity during starvation conditions. Using this method, dynamic changes of polarity during wound healing of zebrafish are monitored for the first time. Upon an amputation performed at the zebrafish tail, stronger PPh-CDs fluorescence appeared at the wound sites, and the intensity increased for 25 min and then gradually decreased. This report provides an important experimental basis for investigating wound healing by employing polarity-sensitive CDs."
268,"Background: Difference between combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle training in same respiratory cycle or different cycles remained unclarified. We explored the difference between both patterns of combined trainings in patients with COPD. Methods: In this randomized, open-label, controlled trial, stable COPD subjects trained for 48 minutes daily, for 8 weeks, using a monitoring device for quality control. Ninety-two subjects were randomly and equally assigned for sham training, inspiratory muscle training(IMT), combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle training in same cycle(CTSC) or combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle training in different cycles(CTDC). Respiratory muscle strength, as the primary endpoint, was measured before and after training. Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02326181). Results: Respiratory muscle training improved maximal inspiratory pressure(PImax), while no significant difference was found in PImax among IMT, CTSC and CTDC. Maximal expiratory pressure(PEmax) in CTSC and CTDC was greater than IMT(P = 0.026, and P=0.04, respectively) and sham training (P = 0.001). IMT, CTSC, and CTDC shortened inhalation and prolonged exhalation(P < 0.01). Subjects with respiratory muscle weakness in IMT and CTDC exhibited greater increase in PImax than those without. IMT, CTSC and CTDC showed no difference in symptoms and quality of life scales among themselves(P > 0.05). Conclusion: Both patterns of CTSC and CTDC improved inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, while IMT alone only raised PImax. Respiratory muscle training might change the respiratory cycles, and be more beneficial for COPD patients with inspiratory muscle weakness."
269,"COVID-19 mortality is primarily driven by abnormal alveolar fluid metabolism of the lung, leading to fluid accumulation in the alveolar airspace. This condition is generally referred to as pulmonary edema and is a direct consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. There are multiple potential mechanisms leading to pulmonary edema in severe Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients and understanding of those mechanisms may enable proper management of this condition. Here, we provide a perspective on abnormal lung humoral metabolism of pulmonary edema in COVID-19 patients, review the mechanisms by which pulmonary edema may be induced in COVID-19 patients, and propose putative drug targets that may be of use in treating COVID-19. Among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against COVID-19, little attention has been paid to abnormal lung humoral metabolism. Perplexingly, successful balance of lung humoral metabolism may lead to the reduction of the number of COVID-19 death limiting the possibility of healthcare services with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration."
270,"Objective Embedding researchers within health systems results in more socially relevant research and more effective uptake of evidence into policy and practice. However, the practice of embedded health service research remains poorly understood. We explored and assessed the development of embedded participatory approaches to health service research by a health research team in Kenya highlighting the different ways multiple stakeholders were engaged in a neonatal research study. Methods We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with key stakeholders. Data were analysed thematically using both inductive and deductive approaches. Setting Over recent years, the Health Services Unit within the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Nairobi Kenya, has been working closely with organisations and technical stakeholders including, but not limited to, medical and nursing schools, frontline health workers, senior paediatricians, policymakers and county officials, in developing and conducting embedded health research. This involves researchers embedding themselves in the contexts in which they carry out their research (mainly in county hospitals, local universities and other training institutions), creating and sustaining social networks. Researchers collaboratively worked with stakeholders to identify clinical, operational and behavioural issues related to routine service delivery, formulating and exploring research questions to bring change in practice Participants We purposively selected 14 relevant stakeholders spanning policy, training institutions, healthcare workers, regulatory councils and professional associations. Results The value of embeddedness is highlighted through the description of a recently completed project, Health Services that Deliver for Newborns (HSD-N). We describe how the HSD-N research process contributed to and further strengthened a collaborative research platform and illustrating this project's role in identifying and generating ideas about how to tackle health service delivery problems Conclusions We conclude with a discussion about the experiences, challenges and lessons learned regarding engaging stakeholders in the coproduction of research."
271,"Industrial development has brought about not only rapid economic growth, but also serious environmental pollution in China, which has led to serious health problems and heavy economic burdens on healthcare. Therefore, the relationship between the industrial air pollution and health care expenditure (HCE) has attracted the attention of researchers, most of which used the traditional empirical methods, such as ordinary least squares (OLS), logistic and so on. By collecting the panel data of 30 provinces of China during 2005-2016, this paper attempts to use the Bayesian quantile regression (BQR) to reveal the impact of industrial air pollution represented by industrial waste gas emission (IWGE) on HCE in high-, middle-, low-income regions. It was found that double heterogeneity in the influence of IWGE on HCE was obvious, which revealed that people in high-, middle-, low-income regions have significantly different understandings of environmental pollution and health problems. In addition, the BQR method provided more information than the traditional empirical methods, which verified that the BQR method, as a new empirical method for previous studies, was applicable in this topic and expanded the discussion space of this research field."
272,"Background Estimates of incidence of switching to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) among children with HIV are necessary to inform the need for paediatric second-line formulations. We aimed to quantify the cumulative incidence of switching to second-line ART among children in an international cohort collaboration. Methods In this international cohort collaboration study, we pooled individual patient-level data for children younger than 18 years who initiated ART (two or more nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [NRTI] plus a non-NRTI [NNRTI] or boosted protease inhibitor) between 1993 and 2015 from 12 observational cohort networks in the Collaborative Initiative for Paediatric HIV Education and Research (CIPHER) Global Cohort Collaboration. Patients who were reported to be horizontally infected with HIV and those who were enrolled in trials of treatment monitoring, switching, or interruption strategies were excluded. Switch to second-line ART was defined as change of one or more NRTI plus either change in drug class (NNRTI to protease inhibitor or vice versa) or protease inhibitor change, change from single to dual protease inhibitor, or addition of a new drug class. We used cumulative incidence curves to assess time to switching, and multivariable proportional hazards models to explore patient-level and cohort-level factors associated with switching, with death and loss to follow-up as competing risks. Findings At the data cutoff of Sept 16, 2015, 182 747 children with HIV were included in the CIPHER dataset, of whom 93 351 were eligible, with 83 984 (90.0%) from sub-Saharan Africa. At ART initiation, the median patient age was 3.9 years (IQR 1.6-6.9) and 82 885 (88.8%) patients initiated NNRTI-based and 10 466 (11.2%) initiated protease inhibitor-based regimens. Median duration of follow-up after ART initiation was 26 months (IQR 9-52). 3883 (4.2%) patients switched to second-line ART after a median of 35 months (IQR 20-57) of ART. The cumulative incidence of switching at 3 years was 3.1% (95% CI 3.0-3.2), but this estimate varied widely depending on the cohort monitoring strategy, from 6.8% (6.5-7.2) in settings with routine monitoring of CD4 (CD4% or CD4 count) and viral load to 0.8% (0.6-1.0) in settings with clinical only monitoring. In multivariable analyses, patient-level factors associated with an increased likelihood of switching were male sex, older age at ART initiation, and initial NNRTI-based regimen (p<0.0001). Cohort-level factors that increased the likelihood of switching were higher-income country (p=0.0017) and routine or targeted monitoring of CD4 and viral load (p<0.0001), which was associated with a 166% increase in likelihood of switching compared with CD4 only monitoring (subdistributional hazard ratio 2.66, 95% CI 2.22-3.19). Interpretation Our global paediatric analysis found wide variations in the incidence of switching to second-line ART across monitoring strategies. These findings suggest the scale-up of viral load monitoring would probably increase demand for paediatric second-line ART formulations. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
273,"The particular characteristics of COVID-19 demand the careful biomedical study of samples from patients who have shown different symptomatology, in order to understand the genetic foundations of its phenotypic expression. Research on genetic material from COVID-19 patients is indispensable for understanding the biological bases for its varied clinical manifestations. The issue of informed consent constitutes the crux of the problem in regulating research biobanks, because it concerns the relationship between the person and the parts separated from the body. There are several consensus models that can be adopted, varying from quite restricted models of specific informed consent to forms that allow very broad authorization (open consent). Our current understanding of COVID-19 is incomplete. Thus, we cannot plan, with precision, the research to be conducted on biological samples that have been, or will be, collected from patients infected by the novel coronavirus. Therefore, we suggest utilizing the participation pact between researchers and donors, based on a new form of participation in research, which offers a choice based on the principles of solidarity and reciprocity, which represent the communication of values. In the last part of this paper, the general data protection regulation concerning the matter is discussed. The treatment of personal data must be performed with explicit goals, and donors must be provided with a clear, transparent explanation of the methods, goals and time of storage. The data must not be provided to unauthorized subjects. In conclusion, open informed consent forms will be necessary for research on individual patients and on populations."
274,"IntroductionTo explore the chronological trends in clinical features and utilization of healthcare resources for hospitalized patients with urolithiasis in China.MethodsPatients with urolithiasis were extracted from the Hospital Quality Monitoring System, a national database of hospitalized patients in China, based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes. Variables including demographic characteristics, comorbidities, treatment modalities for urolithiasis, length of hospital stay, and expenditures were collected and analyzed. ResultsAmong 79.8 million hospitalized patients, 3.5 million were diagnosed with urolithiasis with an increasing trend (from 3.0% in 2013 to 4.0% in 2018). Most of these patients had upper urinary tract calculi (76.6% in 2013 and 81.7% in 2018). Middle-aged patients (46-65 years) constituted the largest proportion with a stable trend (from 46.9% in 2013 to 48.8% in 2018), while the proportion of older patients (>65 years) showed an increasing trend (from 23.7% in 2013 to 27.4% in 2018). The percentages of gout/hyperuricemia, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease among the hospitalized patients with urolithiasis increased steadily, with the sharpest increases in patients from rural areas. Overall, 656,952 patients (18.9%) received surgical interventions for urolithiasis. The proportions of ureteroscopy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy increased steadily during the 6-year study period, with simultaneous decreases in open surgery and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The median length of hospital stay decreased from 10 days to 8 days. The cost for urolithiasis intervention accounted for 2.0% of the total hospitalization fee in 2013, and increased to 2.7% in 2018.ConclusionsThe analysis showed an increasing trend in the percentage of hospitalized patients with urolithiasis, accompanied by an increased percentage of the total hospitalization fee for urolithiasis intervention during the 6-year study period. Based on the increasing trends in the proportion of older patients (>65 years) and percentages of metabolic comorbidities among patients with urolithiasis, an increased burden of urolithiasis on the healthcare system in China is anticipated."
275,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied in numerous scientific domains. In biomedicine, AI has already shown tremendous potential, e.g., in the interpretation of next-generation sequencing data and in the design of clinical decision support systems. Objectives However, training an AI model on sensitive data raises concerns about the privacy of individual participants. For example, summary statistics of a genome-wide association study can be used to determine the presence or absence of an individual in a given dataset. This considerable privacy risk has led to restrictions in accessing genomic and other biomedical data, which is detrimental for collaborative research and impedes scientific progress. Hence, there has been a substantial effort to develop AI methods that can learn from sensitive data while protecting individuals' privacy. Method This paper provides a structured overview of recent advances in privacy-preserving AI techniques in biomedicine. It places the most important state-of-the-art approaches within a unified taxonomy and discusses their strengths, limitations, and open problems. Conclusion As the most promising direction, we suggest combining federated machine learning as a more scalable approach with other additional privacy-preserving techniques. This would allow to merge the advantages to provide privacy guarantees in a distributed way for biomedical applications. Nonetheless, more research is necessary as hybrid approaches pose new challenges such as additional network or computation overhead."
276,"Diesel exhaust particulate matter (DPM), which has been clarified as a Group I carcinogenic agent, is still challenging in its detoxification due to the complex composition and toxic mechanisms. Astaxanthin (AST) is a pleiotropic small biological molecule widely used in medical and healthcare with surprising effects and applications. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of AST on DPM-induced injury and the underlying mechanism. Our results indicated that AST significantly suppressed the generation of phosphorylated histone H2AX (& gamma;-H2AX, marker of DNA damage) and inflammation caused by DPM both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, AST prevented the endocytosis and intracellular accumulation of DPM via regulating the stability and fluidity of plasma membranes. Moreover, the oxidative stress elicited by DPM in cells could also be effectively inhibited by AST, together with protecting the structure and function of mitochondria. These investigations provided clear evidence that AST notably reduced DPM invasion and intracellular accumulation by modulating the membrane-endocytotic pathway, which eventually reduced intracellular oxidative stress caused by DPM. Our data might provide a novel clue for curing and treating the harmful effects of particulate matter."
277,"Human body surfaces, such as the skin, intestines, and respiratory and urogenital tracts, are colonized by a large number of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, with the gut being the most densely and extensively colonized organ. The microbiome plays an essential role in immune system development and tissue homeostasis. Gut microbiota dysbiosis not only modulates the immune responses of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract but also impacts the immunity of distal organs, such as the lung, further affecting lung health and respiratory diseases. Here, we review the recent evidence of the correlations and underlying mechanisms of the relationship between the gut microbiota and common respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), lung cancer, and respiratory infection, and probiotic development as a therapeutic intervention for these diseases."
278,"Background Globally, there are estimated 425 million people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with 80% from low-middle income countries (LMIC). Diabetes self-management education (DSME) programmes are a vital and core component of the treatment pathway for T2D. Despite LMIC being disproportionally affected by T2D, there are no DSME available that meet international diabetes federation criterion. Methods The aims were to test the feasibility of delivering a proven effective and cost-effective approach used in a UK population in two urban settings in Malawi and Mozambique by; (1) developing a culturally, contextually and linguistically adapted DSME, the EXTending availability of self-management structured EducatioN programmes for people with type 2 Diabetes in low-to-middle income countries (EXTEND) programme; (2) using a mixed-method approach to evaluate the delivery of training and the EXTEND programme to patients with T2D. Results Twelve healthcare professionals were trained. Ninety-eight participants received the DSME. Retention was high (100% in Mozambique and 94% in Malawi). At 6 months HbA1c (-0.9%), cholesterol (-0.3 mmol/L), blood pressure (-5.9 mm Hg systolic and -6.1 mm Hg diastolic) improved in addition to indicators of well-being (problem areas in diabetes and self-efficacy in diabetes). Conclusion It is feasible to deliver and evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally, contextually and linguistically adapted EXTEND programme in two LMIC. The DSME was acceptable with positive biomedical and psychological outcomes but requires formal testing with cost-effectiveness. Challenges exist in scaling up such an approach in health systems that do not have resources to address the challenge of diabetes."
279,"This paper presents mu KG, an open-source Python library for representation learning over knowledge graphs. mu KG supports joint representation learning over multi-source knowledge graphs (and also a single knowledge graph), multiple deep learning libraries (PyTorch and TensorFlow2), multiple embedding tasks (link prediction, entity alignment, entity typing, and multi-source link prediction), and multiple parallel computing modes (multi-process and multi-GPU computing). It currently implements 26 popular knowledge graph embedding models and supports 16 benchmark datasets. mu KG provides advanced implementations of embedding techniques with simplified pipelines of different tasks. It also comes with high-quality documentation for ease of use. mu KG is more comprehensive than existing knowledge graph embedding libraries. It is useful for a thorough comparison and analysis of various embedding models and tasks. We show that the jointly learned embeddings can greatly help knowledge-powered downstream tasks, such as multi-hop knowledge graph question answering. We will stay abreast of the latest developments in the related fields and incorporate them into mu KG."
280,"Objective To assess whether the multitherapy antenatal education 'CTLB' (Complementary Therapies for Labour and Birth) Study programme leads to net cost savings. Design Cost analysis of the CTLB Study, using analysis of outcomes and hospital funding data. Methods We take a payer perspective and use Australian Refined Diagnosis-Related Group (AR-DRG) cost data to estimate the potential savings per woman to the payer (government or private insurer). We consider scenarios in which the intervention cost is either borne by the woman or by the payer. Savings are computed as the difference in total cost between the control group and the study group. Results If the cost of the intervention is not borne by the payer, the average saving to the payer was calculated to be $A808 per woman. If the payer covers the cost of the programme, this figure reduces to $A659 since the average cost of delivering the programme was $A149 per woman. All these findings are significant at the 95% confidence level. Significantly more women in the study group experienced a normal vaginal birth, and significantly fewer women in the study group experienced a caesarean section. The main cost saving resulted from the reduced rate of caesarean section in the study group. Conclusion The CTLB antenatal education programme leads to significant savings to payers that come from reduced use of hospital resources. Depending on which perspective is considered, and who is responsible for covering the cost of the programme, the net savings vary from $A659 to $A808 per woman. Compared with the average cost of birth in the control group, we conclude that the programme could lead to a reduction in birth-related healthcare costs of approximately 9%."
281,"Growing evidence suggests that the airway microbiota might be involved in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Understanding this relationship requires examination of a large-scale population for a long duration to accurately monitor changes in the microbiome. This type of longitudinal study requires an appropriate sampling strategy; two options are the collection of sputum or oropharyngeal swabs. Comparative analysis of the changes that occur in these two specimen types has not been previously performed. This observational study was conducted to explore oropharyngeal microbial community dynamics over time and to examine the relationship between oropharyngeal swabs and sputum. A total of 114 samples were collected from four patients suffering from severe AECOPD. Bacterial and fungal communities were evaluated using 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing. Interindividual differences were found in bacterial community structure, but the core genera were shared by both sample types and included 32 lineages. Most of the core genera were members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Ascomycota. Although the oropharyngeal samples showed higher bacterial alpha diversity, the two sample types generated rather similar taxonomic profiles. These results suggest that the sputum microbiome is remarkably similar to the oropharyngeal microbiome. Thus, oropharyngeal swabs can potentially be used instead of sputum samples for patients with exacerbation of COPD."
282,"Objective. Dengue has become a serious public health problem in southern China particularly with a record-breaking outbreak in 2014. Serological evidence from areas with no known dengue cases reported prior to 2014 could provide information on possible unrecognized circulation of dengue virus (DENV) before this outbreak. Method. Between March and May 2015, we performed a cross-sectional serosurvey using a stratified random sampling method among individuals aged 1-84 years-old in 7 communities in Guangzhou with no reported dengue cases before 2014. Sera of subjects were initially screened with the indirect DENV IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and positive samples were further tested by the indirect immunofluorescence assay to identify specific serotypes. Results. A total of 850 subjects had complete information available. The overall seroprevalence against DENV was 6.59% (56 of 850; 95% CI, 4.92%-8.26%). The seroprevalence increased with age in general (3.86%, 4.58%, 8.72%, 7.22%, and 10.69% among participants in <= 14, 15-29, 30-44, 45-59 and >= 60 years age group, respectively). Living in rural or peri-urban communities and longer years of residence therein were risk factors for higher seroprevalence, whereas wearing long sleeves and pants when outdoors was associated with lower seroprevalence. Of the total subjects, 55.36% (31 of 56) sera were successfully identified with specific serotypes, with 12.90% (4 of 31) being coinfected with 2 serotypes. Conclusions. Dengue transmission in the study communities had occurred prior to the 2014 massive outbreak, possibly for many years, but went undiagnosed and unreported. A proportion of the study population experienced secondary infection as different serotypes of DENV increased the risk for severe diseases. Active surveillance and education of both healthcare providers and the general population should be conducted in areas at risk for dengue emergence in order to better reduce disease burden."
283,"Nanomaterials that mimic the catalytic activity of natural enzymes in the complex biological environment of the human body are called nanozymes. Recently, nanozyme systems have been reported with diagnostic, imaging, and/or therapeutic capabilities. Smart nanozymes strategically exploit the tumor microenvironment (TME) by the in situ generation of reactive species or by the modulation of the TME itself to result in effective cancer therapy. This topical review focuses on such smart nanozymes for cancer diagnosis, and therapy modalities with enhanced therapeutic effects. The dominant factors that guide the rational design and synthesis of nanozymes for cancer therapy include an understanding of the dynamic TME, structure-activity relationships, surface chemistry for imparting selectivity, and site-specific therapy, and stimulus-responsive modulation of nanozyme activity. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the subject including the diverse catalytic mechanisms of different types of nanozyme systems, an overview of the TME, cancer diagnosis, and synergistic cancer therapies. The strategic application of nanozymes in cancer treatment can well be a game changer in future oncology. Moreover, recent developments may pave the way for the deployment of nanozyme therapy into other complex healthcare challenges, such as genetic diseases, immune disorders, and ageing."
284,"Introduction Many hospitalised older adults experience delayed discharges due to increased postacute health and social support needs. Transitional care programmes (TCPs) provide short-term care to these patients to prepare them for transfer to nursing homes or back to the community with supports. There are knowledge gaps related to the development, implementation and evaluation of TCPs. The aims of this scoping review (ScR) are to identify the characteristics of older patients served by TCPs; criteria for transfer, components and services provided by TCPs; and outcomes used to evaluate TCPs. Methods and analysis The study involves six-step ScR and is informed by a collaborative/participatory approach whereby stakeholders engage in the development of the research questions, identification of literature, data abstraction and synthesis; and participation in consultation workshop. The search for scientific literature will be done in the Medline, PsychINFO, Emcare and CINAHL databases; as well, policies and reports that examined models of transitional care and the outcomes used to evaluate them will be reviewed. Records will be selected if they involve community dwelling older adults aged 65 years or older, or indigenous persons 45 years or older; and presented in English, French, Dutch and German languages. Records will be screened, reviewed and abstracted by two independent reviewers. Extracted data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and a narrative analysis, and organised according to Donabedians model of structure (characteristics of older adults experiencing delayed discharge and served by TCPs), process (TCP components and services) and outcome. Ethics and dissemination This ScR does not require ethics approval. Dissemination activities include integrated knowledge translation (KT) (consultation with stakeholders throughout the study) and end-of-grant KT strategies (presentations at national and international conferences; and publication in peer-reviewed interdisciplinary journal)."
285,"Background: Internationally, guidelines for depression recommend a stepped care approach, implying that antidepressant medication should not be offered as a first step treatment to patients with sub-threshold or mild depression. In the Netherlands, antidepressant prescribing rates in general practice as a first treatment step are considered to be high. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of guideline recommendations on antidepressant prescribing. Methods: A quasi-experimental study with a non-equivalent naturalistic control group and three years follow-up was performed in the general practice setting in the Netherlands. General Practitioners (GPs) participated in a national Quality Improvement Collaborative (QIC), focusing on the implementation of a guideline based model for a stepped care approach to depression. The model consisted of self-help and psychological treatment options for patients with milder symptoms as an alternative to antidepressants in general practice. Changes in antidepressant prescription rates of GPs were documented for a three-year period and compared to those in a control group of GPs, selected from an ongoing national registration network. Results: A decrease of 23.3% (49.4%-26.1%) in antidepressant prescription rates for newly diagnosed patients with depressive symptoms was found within the intervention group, whereas no difference occurred in the reference group (50.3%-52.6%). The decrease over time was significant, compared to the usual care group (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.92). Conclusions: An implementation program using stepped care principles for the allocation of depression interventions resulted in reduced antidepressant prescription rates in general practice. GPs can change prescribing behaviour within the context of a QIC."
286,"In this paper, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction (UAEE) was employed in polysaccharides extraction from Lonicerae japonica leaves (LJLP). The optimal extraction conditions (extraction time of 33 min, PEG concentration of 30%, and ultrasonic power of 191 W) were obtained by Box-Behnken design (BBD). Under this condition, the LJLP yield was 14.76%. Furthermore, LJLP was identified as a typical heteropolysaccharide considering the main constitutive monosaccharides include galactose (32.3%), glucose (20.9%), and ribose (15.2%). Moreover, LJLP exhibited high total reducing power and considerable scavenging activities on superoxide radicals, in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, antioxidant analysis in vivo revealed that for the LJLP-treated mice, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) activities, and total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) were significantly increased, while the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was decreased in both serum and liver."
287,"Dysbiotic airway microbiota play important roles in the inflammatory progression of asthma, and exploration of airway microbial interactions further elucidates asthma pathogenesis. However, little is known regarding the airway bacterial-fungal interactions in asthma patients. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the sputum bacterial and fungal microbiota from 116 clinically stable asthma patients and 29 healthy controls using 16S rRNA gene and ITS1 sequencing. Compared with healthy individuals, asthma patients exhibited a significantly altered microbiota and increased bacterial and fungal alpha diversities in the airway. Microbial generaMoraxella,Capnocytophaga, andRalstonia(bacteria) andSchizophyllum,Candida, andPhialemoniopsis(fungi) were more abundant in the asthma airways, whileRothia,VeillonellaandLeptotrichia(bacteria) andMeyerozyma(fungus) were increased in healthy controls. The Moraxellaceae family and their genusMoraxellawere significantly enriched in asthma patients compared with healthy controls (80.5-fold,P= 0.007 and 314.7-fold,P= 0.027, respectively). Moreover, Moraxellaceae, along withSchizophyllum,Candida, andAspergillus(fungal genera), were positively associated with fungal alpha diversity. Correlation networks revealed 3 fungal genera (Schizophyllum,Candida, andAspergillus) as important airway microbes in asthma that showed positive correlations with each other and multiple co-exclusions with other common microbiota. Moraxellaceae members were positively associated with asthma-enriched fungal taxa but negatively related to several healthy-enriched bacterial taxa. Collectively, our findings revealed an altered microbiota and complex microbial interactions in the airways of asthma patients. The Moraxellaceae family and their genusMoraxella, along with 3 important fungal taxa, showed significant interactions with the airway microbiota, providing potential insights into the novel pathogenic mechanisms of asthma."
288,"Introduction Multimorbidity is widely recognised as the presence of two or more concurrent long-term conditions, yet remains a poorly understood global issue despite increasing in prevalence. We have created the Wales Multimorbidity e-Cohort (WMC) to provide an accessible research ready data asset to further the understanding of multimorbidity. Our objectives are to create a platform to support research which would help to understand prevalence, trajectories and determinants in multimorbidity, characterise clusters that lead to highest burden on individuals and healthcare services, and evaluate and provide new multimorbidity phenotypes and algorithms to the National Health Service and research communities to support prevention, healthcare planning and the management of individuals with multimorbidity. Methods and analysis The WMC has been created and derived from multisourced demographic, administrative and electronic health record data relating to the Welsh population in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. The WMC consists of 2.9 million people alive and living in Wales on the 1 January 2000 with follow-up until 31 December 2019, Welsh residency break or death. Published comorbidity indices and phenotype code lists will be used to measure and conceptualise multimorbidity. Study outcomes will include: (1) a description of multimorbidity using published data phenotype algorithms/ontologies, (2) investigation of the associations between baseline demographic factors and multimorbidity, (3) identification of temporal trajectories of clusters of conditions and multimorbidity and (4) investigation of multimorbidity clusters with poor outcomes such as mortality and high healthcare service utilisation. Ethics and dissemination The SAIL Databank independent Information Governance Review Panel has approved this study (SAIL Project: 0911). Study findings will be presented to policy groups, public meetings, national and international conferences, and published in peer-reviewed journals."
289,"Purpose: As an important measure to alleviate long-term care (LTC) costs for the disabled due to the aging of the population, long-term care insurance (LTCI) system has been paid more attention in China. In addition to the government-led public LTCI system that has been piloted in cities such as Qingdao, Chongqing and Shanghai, health insurers such as the China Life Insurance Company are also experimenting with various types of commercial LTCI in the private market. However, the commercial LTCI market is developing very slowly due to public awareness and other reasons. On the other hand, COVID-2019 has had an impact on the cognition of the importance of long-term care for the elderly due to the fact that the death cases of COVID-2019 have been mainly concentrated in the elderly population with chronic diseases such as hypertension. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the differences in the purchase intention of commercial LTCI among the elderly in two different periods: before and after the outbreak of COVID-2019. Methods: By using the Andersen behavioral model and two investigations in two different periods before and after the outbreak of COVID-2019, this study explores the impacts of COVID-2019 on the purchase intention of commercial LTCI. Results: Some significant discoveries were found. For example, 25.8% of interviewees showed purchase intention in LTCI in the time before the COVID-2019 outbreak, while this proportion increased to 37.6% after the COVID-2019 outbreak. People who were younger (OR = 2.128, before COVID-2019; OR = 1.875, after COVID-2019) or who had more education (OR = 1.502, before COVID-2019; OR = 2.218, after COVID-2019) were more interested in commercial LTCI. Conclusion: This study shows that COVID-2019 has had an obvious impact on the purchase intention of commercial LTCI, which provides some enlightenment for China to improve the LTCI system in the future, especially to accelerate the development of commercial LTCI. For example, it is essential to promote the importance of long-term care among the elderly in a focused and targeted way. In terms of the key target audience, it can be developed gradually from the groups with higher education levels and the middle elderly aged 45-64 years old."
290,"Background Child mortality rates remain unacceptably high in low-resource settings. Cause of death (CoD) is often unknown. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS)-using biopsy needles to obtain post-mortem samples-for histopathological and microbiologic investigation is increasingly being promoted to improve child and adult CoD attribution. MITS in Malawi is a sub-study of the Childhood Acute Illness & Nutrition (CHAIN) Network, which aims to identify biological and socioeconomic mortality risk factors among young children hospitalized for acute illness or undernutrition. MITS in Malawi employs standard MITS and a novel post-mortem endoscopic intestinal sampling approach to better understand CoD among children with acute illness and/or malnutrition who die during hospitalization. Aim To understand factors that may impact MITS acceptability and inform introduction of the procedure to ascertain CoD among children with acute illness or malnutrition who die during hospitalization in Malawi. Methods We conducted eight focus group discussions with key hospital staff and community members (religious leaders and parents of children under 5) to explore attitudes towards MITS and inform consent processes prior to commencing the MITS in Malawi study. We used thematic content analysis drawing on a conceptual framework developed from emergent themes and MITS acceptability literature. Results Feelings of power over decision-making within the hospital and household, trust in health systems, and open and respectful health worker communication with parents were important dimensions of MITS acceptability. Other facilitating factors included the potential for MITS to add CoD information to aid sense-making of death and contribute to medical knowledge and new interventions. Potential barriers to acceptability included fears of organ and blood harvesting, disfigurement to the body, and disruption to transportation and burial plans. Conclusion Social relationships and power dynamics within healthcare systems and households are a critical component of MITS acceptability, especially given the sensitivity of death and autopsy."
291,"Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) base-aptamer gate-lock  biomaterial probes have been synthesized for monitoring intracellular deoxynivalenol (DON) and cytochrome c (cyt c) levels. The aptamer and organic fluorescent dye were regarded as a recognition element and a sensing element, respectively. In the presence of DON, the aptamers of DON and cyt c were specifically bound with the DON and induced cyt c, leading to the dissociation of aptamers from the porous surface of the probes. The gate was subsequently opened to release methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G), and their fluorescence (emission of MB at 700 nm and Rh6G at 550 nm) significantly recovered within 6 h. Cell imaging successfully monitored the exposure of DON and the biological process of cyt c discharge triggered by the activation of the DON-induced apoptosis pathway. In addition, the response between DON and cyt c was observed during the apoptosis process, which is of high significance for the comprehensive and systematic development of mycotoxins cytotoxicity."
292,"Background There is a growing focus on the development of multi-factorial cancer risk prediction algorithms alongside tools that operationalise them for clinical use. BOADICEA is a breast and ovarian cancer risk prediction model incorporating genetic and other risk factors. A new user-friendly Web-based tool (CanRisk.org) has been developed to apply BOADICEA. This study aimed to explore the acceptability of the prototype CanRisk tool among two healthcare professional groups to inform further development, evaluation and implementation. Method A multi-methods approach was used. Clinicians from primary care and specialist genetics clinics in England, France and Germany were invited to use the CanRisk prototype with two test cases (either face-to-face with a simulated patient or via a written vignette). Their views about the tool were examined via a semi-structured interview or equivalent open-ended questionnaire. Qualitative data were subjected to thematic analysis and organised around Sekhon's Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Results Seventy-five clinicians participated, 21 from primary care and 54 from specialist genetics clinics. Participants were from England (n = 37), France (n = 23) and Germany (n = 15). The prototype CanRisk tool was generally acceptable to most participants due to its intuitive design. Primary care clinicians were concerned about the amount of time needed to complete, interpret and communicate risk information. Clinicians from both settings were apprehensive about the impact of the CanRisk tool on their consultations and lack of opportunities to interpret risk scores before sharing them with their patients. Conclusions The findings highlight the challenges associated with developing a complex tool for use in different clinical settings; they also helped refine the tool. This prototype may not have been versatile enough for clinical use in both primary care and specialist genetics clinics where the needs of clinicians are different, emphasising the importance of understanding the clinical context when developing cancer risk assessment tools."
293,"UK Biobank is a major prospective epidemiological study, including multimodal brain imaging, genetics and ongoing health outcomes. Previously, we published genome-wide associations of 3,144 brain imaging-derived phenotypes, with a discovery sample of 8,428 individuals. Here we present a new open resource of genome-wide association study summary statistics, using the 2020 data release, almost tripling the discovery sample size. We now include the X chromosome and new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes (subcortical volumes and tissue contrast). Previously, we found 148 replicated clusters of associations between genetic variants and imaging phenotypes; in this study, we found 692, including 12 on the X chromosome. We describe some of the newly found associations, focusing on the X chromosome and autosomal associations involving the new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes. Our novel associations implicate, for example, pathways involved in the rare X-linked STAR (syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations) syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and mitochondrial disorders. The Elliott and Smith teams used imaging and genetics data from 40,000 volunteers in the UK Biobank healthcare study, discovering new genetic influences over brain structure and function, which are of relevance to both rare and common diseases."
294,"An emerging understanding of natural biolubricants such as saliva and synovial fluid reveals that they rely on synergistic interactions between biomacromolecules in aqueous media, wherein one polymeric component promotes adsorption to biological substrates while another facilitates hydration lubrication. We hypothesize that this phenomenon can be achieved by combining the strong adsorption characteristics of proteins with the hydration of polysaccharides. To confirm this hypothesis, hydrated soluble complexes were formed through electrostatic interactions between positively-charged lysozyme molecules and anionic residues on pectic polysaccharides extracted from Plantago ovata seed mucilage. Boundary friction was measured between smooth hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces using a ball-and-disk tribometer, while adsorption was assessed using a combination of the quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring technique and ellipsometry. The results indicate that complexation between polysaccharides and proteins leads to improved adsorption on hydrophobic PDMS surfaces, which in turn decreases boundary friction in sliding contact. By comparing the adsorption behaviour of the complexes and individual components, we conclude that pectic polymers maintain the film's hydration while lysozyme improves surface adsorption, thereby providing new evidence that physical complexes can be utilised to design bi-functional surface layers. Our findings open up a range of opportunities for application in food and oral healthcare products, particularly in the use of foodcompatible ingredients to control aqueous lubrication."
295,"Background: The rapid aging of populations in some countries has led to a growing number of the disabled elderly, creating a huge need for Long-Term Care (LTC) and meeting its costs, which is a heavy economic burden on the families of the disabled elderly and governments. Therefore, the measurement of Long-Term Care (LTC) costs has become an important basis for the government to formulate Long-Term Care (LTC) policies, and academic research on Long-Term Care (LTC) costs is also in the process of continuous development and deepening. Methods: This is a systematic review that aims to examine the evidence published in the last decade (2010-2019) regarding the comparison of the measurement of Long-Term Care (LTC) costs between China and other countries. Results: Eighteen Chinese studies and 17 other countries' studies were included in this review. Most Chinese scholars estimated long-term care costs based on the degree of disability among the disabled elderly. However, the studies of European and American countries are more and more in-depth and comprehensive, and more detailed regarding the post-care cost of specific diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy. Conclusion: In future academic research, we should fully consider the human value of long-term care providers and further study the differences in the long-term care costs of different chronic diseases. In China's future policymaking, according to the experience of Germany, Sweden, and other countries, it may be an effective way to develop private long-term care insurance and realize the effective complementarity between private long-term care insurance and public long-term care insurance (LTCI)."
296,"Designing artificial avatars able to interact with humans in a safe, smart, and natural way is a current open problem in control. Solving such an issue will allow the design of cyber-agents capable of cooperatively interacting with people in order to fulfil common joint tasks in a multitude of different applications. This is particularly relevant in the context of healthcare applications. Indeed, the use for rehabilitation has been proposed of artificial agents able to interact and coordinate their movements with those of patients suffering from social or motor disorders. Moreover, it has also been shown that the level of motor coordination between the avatar and the human patient is enhanced if the kinematic properties of the avatar's motion are similar to those of the individual it is interacting with. In this article, we discuss, first, a new method based on Markov chains to confer human motor characteristics on the motion of a virtual agent so that it can coordinate its motion with that of a target individual while exhibiting specific kinematic properties. Then, we embed such synthetic model in a novel control architecture based on reinforcement learning to synthesize a cyber-agent able to mimic the behavior of a specific human performing a joint motor task with one or more individuals."
297,"Background: Lifestyle-related diseases are among the leading causes of death and disability. Their rapid increase worldwide has called for low-cost, scalable solutions to promote health behavior changes. Digital health coaching has proved to be effective in delivering affordable, scalable programs to support lifestyle change. This approach increasingly relies on asynchronous text-based interventions to motivate and support behavior change. Although we know that empathy is a core element for a successful coach-user relationship and positive patient outcomes, we lack research on how this is realized in text-based interactions. Systemic functional linguistics (SFL) is a linguistic theory that may support the identification of empathy opportunities (EOs) in text-based interactions, as well as the reasoning behind patients' linguistic choices in their formulation. Objective: This study aims to determine whether empathy and SFL approaches correspond and complement each other satisfactorily to study text-based communication in a health coaching context. We sought to explore whether combining empathic assessment with SFL categories can provide a means to understand client-coach interactions in asynchronous text-based coaching interactions. Methods: We retrieved 148 text messages sent by 29 women who participated in a randomized trial of telecoaching for the prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and postnatal weight loss. We conducted a pilot study to identify users' explicit and implicit EOs and further investigated these statements using the SFL approach, focusing on the analysis of transitivity and thematic analysis. Results: We identified 164 EOs present in 42.37% (3478/8209) of the word count in the corpus. These were mainly negative (n=90, 54.88%) and implicit (n=55, 60.00%). We distinguished opening, content and closing messages structures. Most of the wording was found in the content (n=7077, 86.21%) with a declarative structure (n=7084, 86.30%). Processes represented 22.4% (n=1839) of the corpus, with half being material (n=876, 10.67%) and mostly related to food and diet (n=196, 54.92%), physical activity (n=96, 26.89%), and lifestyle goals (n=40, 11.20%). Conclusions: Our findings show that empathy and SFL approaches are compatible. The results from our transitivity analysis reveal novel insights into the meanings of the users' EOs, such as their seek for help or praise, often missed by health care professionals (HCPs), and on the coach-user relationship. The absence of explicit EOs and direct questions could be attributed to low trust on or information about the coach's abilities. In the future, we will conduct further research to explore additional linguistic features and code coach messages."
298,"Objectives The suspension of elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and has resulted in record volumes of patients waiting for operations. Novel approaches that maximise capacity and efficiency of surgical care are urgently required. This study applies Markov multiscale community detection (MMCD), an unsupervised graph-based clustering framework, to identify new surgical care models based on pooled waiting-lists delivered across an expanded network of surgical providers. Design Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting Public and private hospitals providing surgical care to National Health Service (NHS) patients in England. Participants All adult patients resident in England undergoing NHS-funded planned surgical procedures between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. Main outcome measures The identification of the most common planned surgical procedures in England (high-volume procedures (HVP)) and proportion of low, medium and high-risk patients undergoing each HVP. The mapping of hospitals providing surgical care onto optimised groupings based on patient usage data. Results A total of 7 811 891 planned operations were identified in 4 284 925 adults during the 1-year period of our study. The 28 most common surgical procedures accounted for a combined 3 907 474 operations (50.0% of the total). 2 412 613 (61.7%) of these most common procedures involved 'low risk' patients. Patients travelled an average of 11.3 km for these procedures. Based on the data, MMCD partitioned England into 45, 16 and 7 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive natural surgical communities of increasing coarseness. The coarser partitions into 16 and seven surgical communities were shown to be associated with balanced supply and demand for surgical care within communities. Conclusions Pooled waiting-lists for low-risk elective procedures and patients across integrated, expanded natural surgical community networks have the potential to increase efficiency by innovatively flexing existing supply to better match demand."
299,"Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR: http://stir.sf.net) is an open source C++ library available for reconstruction of emission tomography data. This work aims at the incorporation of the GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner in STIR and enables PET image reconstruction with data corrections. The data extracted from the scanner after an acquisition includes a list of raw data files (emission, normalisation, geometric and well counter calibration (wcc) factors), magnetic resonance attenuation correction (MRAC) images and the scanner-based reconstructions. The listmode (LM) file stores a list of 'prompt' events and the singles per crystal per second. MRAC images from the scanner are used for attenuation correction. The modifications to STIR that allow accurate histogramming of this LM data in the same sinogram organisation as the scanner are also described. This allows reconstruction of acquisition data with all data corrections using STIR, and independent of any software supplied by the manufacturer. The implementations were validated by comparing the histogrammed data, data corrections and final reconstruction using the ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) algorithm with the equivalents from the GE-toolbox, supplied by the manufacturer for the scanner. There is no difference in the histogrammed counts whereas an overall relative difference of 6:7 x 10(-8)% and from 0:01% to 0:86% is seen in the normalisation and randoms correction sinograms respectively. The STIR reconstructed images have similar resolution and quantification but have some residual differences due to wcc factors, decay and deadtime corrections, as well as the offset between PET and MR gantries that will be addressed in future work. This work will enable the use of all current and future STIR algorithms, including penalized image reconstruction, motion correction and direct parametric image estimation, on data from GE SIGNA PET/MR scanners."
300,"Background/aimsData are limited on the frequency of 'consensus decisions' between sub-specialists attending a neurovascular multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) regarding management of patients with extracranial carotid/vertebral stenoses and post-MDM 'adherence' to such advice.MethodsThis prospective audit/quality improvement project collated prospectively-recorded data from a weekly Neurovascular/Stroke Centre MDM documenting the proportion of extracranial carotid/vertebral stenosis patients in whom 'consensus management decisions' were reached by neurologists, vascular surgeons, stroke physicians-geriatricians and neuroradiologists. Adherence to MDM advice was analysed in asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS), symptomatic carotid stenosis (SCS), 'indeterminate symptomatic status stenosis' (ISS) and vertebral artery stenosis (VAS) patients, including intervals between index event to MDM + / - intervention.ResultsOne hundred fifteen patients were discussed: 108 with carotid stenosis and 7 with VAS. Consensus regarding management was noted in 96.5% (111/115): 100% with ACS and VAS, 96.2% with SCS and 92.9% with ISS. Adherence to MDM management advice was 96.4% (107/111): 100% in ACS, ISS and VAS patients; 92% (46/50) in SCS patients. The median interval from index symptoms to revascularisation in 50-99% SCS patients was 12.5 days (IQR: 9-18.3 days; N = 26), with a median interval from MDM to revascularisation of 5.5 days (IQR: 1-7 days). Thirty patients underwent revascularisation. Two out of twenty-nine patients (6.9%) with either SCS or ISS had a peri-procedural ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, with no further strokes/deaths during 3-months follow-up.ConclusionsThe high frequency of inter-specialty consensus regarding management and adherence to proposed treatment supports a collaborative/multidisciplinary model of care in patients with extracranial arterial stenoses. Service development should aim to shorten times between MDM discussion-intervention and optimise prevention of stroke/death."

We distinguished opening, content and closing messages structures. Most of the wording was found in the content (n=7077, 86.21%) with a declarative structure (n=7084, 86.30%). Processes represented 22.4% (n=1839) of the corpus, with half being material (n=876, 10.67%) and mostly related to food and diet (n=196, 54.92%), physical activity (n=96, 26.89%), and lifestyle goals (n=40, 11.20%). Conclusions: Our findings show that empathy and SFL approaches are compatible. The results from our transitivity analysis reveal novel insights into the meanings of the users' EOs, such as their seek for help or praise, often missed by health care professionals (HCPs), and on the coach-user relationship. The absence of explicit EOs and direct questions could be attributed to low trust on or information about the coach's abilities. In the future, we will conduct further research to explore additional linguistic features and code coach messages."
302,"Objectives This study aimed to describe mental health emergency department (ED) presentations among young people aged 8-26 years in New South Wales, Australia, and to identify key characteristics associated with higher risk of ED mental health re-presentation. Design, setting and participants Retrospective analysis of linked ED data records for mental health presentations between 1 January 2015 and 30 June 2018. Main outcome measures The main outcome was the total number of mental health ED re-presentations within 1 year, following initial presentation. Count regression models were fitted to estimate factors associated with higher likelihood of re-presentations. Results Forty thousand two hundred and ninety patients were included in the analyses, and 9713 (similar to 25%) represented during the following year; 1831 (20%) presented at least three times. On average, patients re-presented 0.61 times per 365 person-days, with average time until first re-presentation of similar to 92 days but greatest risk of representation within first 30-60 days. Young people with self-harm or suicidal diagnoses at initial presentation were more likely to re-present. Re-presentations were highest among young people <15 years (IRR 1.18 vs >= 20 years old), female (IRR=1.13 vs male), young people residing outside of major cities (IRR 1.08 vs major cities) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people (IRR 1.27 vs non-Indigenous). Conclusions ED mental health re-presentation is high among young people. We demonstrate factors associated with re-presentation that EDs could target for timely, high-quality care that is youth friendly and culturally safe, with appropriate referral pathways into community-based primary and mental healthcare services."
303,"The rapid growth of population aging makes providing adequate long-term care (LTC) services for the elderly a serious social dilemma in China. Thus, it is necessary to carry out a theoretical discussion on the LTC service needs of the elderly and find out their influencing factors. With four regions of the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River as the sample case, this study aims to explore the factors that affect LTC service needs of the elderly in the frame of the latest Anderson Model, which added psychosocial factors to predisposing characteristics, enabling factors, and need factors in the old version. Some interesting results have been found, for example, self-image evaluation is composed of several factors such as general physical health, attitude towards life, or psychosocial states. Finally, sub-analyses-namely, by age, by gender, and by educational level-were carried out since the choice of different long-term care service patterns is related to different age/gender/education groups."
304,"Ill-posed image recovery requires regularisation to ensure stability. The presented open-source regularisation toolkit consists of state-of-the-art variational algorithms which can be embedded in a plug-and-play fashion into the general framework of proximal splitting methods. The packaged regularisers aim to satisfy various prior expectations of the investigated objects, e.g., their structural characteristics, smooth or non-smooth surface morphology. The flexibility of the toolkit helps with the design of more advanced model-based iterative reconstruction methods for different imaging modalities while operating with simpler building blocks. The toolkit is written for CPU and GPU architectures and wrapped for Python/MATLAB. We demonstrate the functionality of the toolkit in application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and X-ray synchrotron computed tomography (CT)."
305,"Current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological tests are based on the full-length spike (S), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), or the nucleoprotein (NP) as substrates. Here, we used samples from healthcare workers (HCWs) to perform a longitudinal analysis of the antibody responses using a research-grade RBD and spike-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a commercial RBD and spike-based ELISA, and a commercial NP-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Seroprevalence ranged around 28% early during the pandemic and a good correlation was observed between RBD and spike- based ELISAs. Modest correlations were observed between NP and both RBD and spike-based assays. The antibody levels in HCWs declined over time; however, the overall seroprevalence measured by RBD and spike-based assays remained unchanged, while the seroprevalence of NP-reactive antibodies significantly declined. Moreover, RBD and spike-based assays effectively detected seroconversion in vaccinees. Overall, our results consolidate the strength of different serological assays to assess the magnitude and duration of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2."
306,"Online metric learning (OML) has been widely applied in classification and retrieval. It can automatically learn a suitable metric from data by restricting similar instances to be separated from dissimilar instances with a given margin. However, the existing OML algorithms have limited performance in real-world classifications, especially, when data distributions are complex. To this end, this article proposes a multilayer framework for OML to capture the nonlinear similarities among instances. Different from the traditional OML, which can only learn one metric space, the proposed multilayer OML (MLOML) takes an OML algorithm as a metric layer and learns multiple hierarchical metric spaces, where each metric layer follows a nonlinear layer for the complicated data distribution. Moreover, the forward propagation (FP) strategy and backward propagation (BP) strategy are employed to train the hierarchical metric layers. To build a metric layer of the proposed MLOML, a new Mahalanobis-based OML (MOML) algorithm is presented based on the passive-aggressive strategy and one-pass triplet construction strategy. Furthermore, in a progressively and nonlinearly learning way, MLOML has a stronger learning ability than traditional OML in the case of limited available training data. To make the learning process more explainable and theoretically guaranteed, theoretical analysis is provided. The proposed MLOML enjoys several nice properties, indeed learns a metric progressively, and performs better on the benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments with different settings have been conducted to verify these properties of the proposed MLOML."
307,"Aims: The heterogeneity in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) risk factors among different populations impose challenges in developing a generic prediction model. This study evaluates the predictive ability of existing UK NICE guidelines for assessing GDM risk in Singaporean women, and used machine learning to develop a non-invasive predictive model. Methods: Data from 909 pregnancies in Singapore's most deeply phenotyped mother-offspring cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO), was used for predictive modeling. We used a CatBoost gradient boosting algorithm, and the Shapley feature attribution framework for model building and interpretation of GDM risk attributes. Results: UK NICE guidelines showed poor predictability in Singaporean women [AUC:0.60 (95% CI 0.51, 0.70)]. The non-invasive predictive model comprising of 4 non-invasive factors: mean arterial blood pressure in first trimester, age, ethnicity and previous history of GDM, greatly outperformed [AUC:0.82 (95% CI 0.71, 0.93)] the UK NICE guidelines. Conclusions: The UK NICE guidelines may be insufficient to assess GDM risk in Asian women. Our non-invasive predictive model outperforms the current state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict GDM, is easily accessible and can be an effective approach to minimize the economic burden of universal testing & GDM associated healthcare in Asian populations."
308,"Intramolecular catalytic hairpin assembly (intraCHA) has recently been developed. However, non-nucleic acidinitiated intraCHA is rarely explored. The only protein-initiated intraCHA depends on the unwarrantable binding affinity between protein and its aptamer, which generally results in limited initiation efficiency. Herein, a repaired and initiated intraCHA (RI-intraCHA) nanosystem was designed and its operation was reported for amplified imaging of DNA repair enzyme activity in live cells. 8-oxoguanine (8-OG) DNA glycosylase was selected as the model DNA repair enzyme. The RI-intraCHA nanosystem was constructed by linking a dsDNA (containing 8-OG sites and trigger strand), two hairpins to different vertexes of DNA tetrahedron. The nanosystem could independently enter into live cells in virtue of cell permeability of DNA tetrahedron. Upon repair action of endogenous 8-OG DNA glycosylase, intraCHA reaction in the nanosystem was initiated efficiently, generating amplified fluorescence signal. The nanosystem provided a detection limit of 0.2443 U/mL for 8-OG DNA glycosylase, which was lower than that of the reported imaging approaches. Furthermore, the nanosystem exhibited satisfactory biosafety and biostability, achieving amplified imaging of intracellular 8-OG DNA glycosylase activity. The designed RI-intraCHA nanosystem provided a promising tool for the research of basic biology of intracellular DNA repair enzymes as well as their clinic correlations."
309,"BACKGROUNDTrans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp) is a value-added amino acid that is an applicable chiral building block in some industries, such as the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and healthcare industries. Given that glycerol is a good carbon source for microbial fermentation and a large amount of glycerol is produced by the biodiesel industry, this study investigated a value-added Hyp fermentation from glycerol using an engineered Escherichia coli strain. RESULTSBy optimizing the proline-4-hydroxylase (P4H) gene codons and vectors, a constructed recombinant Escherichia coliBL21 strain successfully converted L-proline to Hyp. With a chemo-physical combination mutagenesis, a high Hyp production strain that can grow with glycerol as a sole carbon source, NA45 was isolated, yielding 1.24gL(-1) from 20gL(-1) glycerol at 12h in a 30 mL/250 mL conical flask fermentation. With further systemic optimization of nutritional elements, the output was enhanced to 1.62gL(-1). In a 5L fermentator, the strain achieved a surprisingly high output of 25.4gL(-1) at 48h in fed batch mode. CONCLUSIONA high Hyp production strain growing well on glycerol as carbon source was successfully engineered, which is a promising candidate for the industrial Hyp production.

310,"Proteins are an important class of biomaterials promising a variety of applications such as drug delivery, and imaging or therapy, owing to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, as well as inherent biological activities acting as enzymes, recognizing molecules, or therapeutics by themselves. Over the few past decades, different types of proteins with desired properties have been widely explored for biomedical applications. Many therapeutic proteins have now entered clinical use. This review therefore summarizes various strategies in the engineering of biomaterials for delivery of therapeutic proteins, as well as the recent development of protein-based biomaterials for cancer theranostics."
311,"Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced charge separation were concentrated on the metal nano particles surface, which made it sensitive to the surface refractive index changes during optical sensing. Similarly, electrochemical detection was based on the electron transformation on the electrode surface. Herein, we fabricated a nanochip by decorating a nanocone-array substrate with gold nanoparticles and silver nano particles for dynamic electro-optical spectroscopy. Mercaptophenyl boronic acid (MPBA) was immobilized firmly on the nanochip by the metal-S bond for sensitive sialic acid sensing. Owing to the high stability of gold nanoparticles and the high sensitivity of silver nanoparticles, the nanochip showed good performance in LSPR detection with rich and high responses. Besides, the nanochip also showed sensitive electrical signals during electrochemical detection due to the excitation of the energetic charges from the nanoparticles surface to the reaction system. The dynamic electro-optical spectroscopy was based on a unique combination of LSPR and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). On the one hand, electrochemical signals activated the electrons on the nanochip to promote the propagation and resonance of surface plasmon. On the other hand, LSPR concentrated the electrons on the nanochip surface, which made the electrons easily driven to enhance the current in electrochemical detection. Results showed that mutual promotion of electrochemical-LSPR on nanochip covered a linear dynamic range from 0.05 mM to 5 mM on selective sialic acid detection with a low detection limit of 17 mu M. The synchronous amplification of the electro-optical response during electrochemical-LSPR, opened up a new perspective for efficient and sensitive biochemical detection."
312,"Despite good evidence of impaired innate antiviral responses in asthma, trials of inhaled interferon-beta given during exacerbations showed only modest benefits in moderate/severe asthma. Using human experimental rhinovirus infection, we observe robust in vivo induction of bronchial epithelial interferon response genes 4 days after virus inoculation in 25 subjects with asthma but not 11 control subjects. This signature correlated with virus loads and lower respiratory symptoms. Our data indicate that the in vivo innate antiviral response is dysregulated in asthma and open up the potential that prophylactic rather than therapeutic interferon therapy may have greater clinical benefit."
313,"The development of portable volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors is essential for home healthcare and workplace safety because VOCs are environmental pollutants that may critically affect human health. Here, we report a compact and portable sensor platform based on a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) array offering multiplex detection of various VOCs (toluene, acetone, ethanol, and methanol) using a single read-out system. Three CMUT resonant devices were functionalized with three different layers: (1) phenyl-selective peptide, (2) colloids of single-walled nanotubes and peptide, and (3) poly(styrene-co-allyl alcohol). As each device exhibited different sensitivities to the four VOCs, we performed principal component analysis to achieve selective detection of all four gases. For the simultaneous detection of VOCs using CMUT sensors, the changes in the resonant frequencies of three devices were monitored in real time, but using only a single oscillator through an electrically controlled relay to achieve compactness. In addition, by devising a wireless system, measurement results were transmitted to a smartphone to monitor the concentration of VOCs. We used multiple sensors to obtain a larger number of fingerprints for pattern recognition to enhance selectivity but interfaced these sensors with a single read-out circuit to minimize the footprint of the overall system. The compact CMUT-based sensor array based on a multiplex detection scheme is a promising sensor platform for portable VOC monitoring."
314,"Flexible and transparent electrodes are highly useful in wearable optoelectronic systems for healthcare and biosensing applications for conducting multimodal assessments with electrophysiological and optical measures. In such systems, the electrodes should exhibit a low sheet resistance, high visible transmittance, and small feature size, for reliable electrical sensing, optical observation of attached objects, and integration of devices for mapping local biology events, respectively. Herein, fine-printed, flexible, and transparent microelectrodes that allow biosensing and device integration are reported. The microelectrodes containing cross-aligned silver nanowire (AgNW) networks are patterned via a selective wetting deposition technique on a 1 mu m-thick polymer substrate. A low sheet resistance of 25 Omega sq(-1) and a visible transmittance of 96%-99% are achieved with a small pattern width of 25 mu m. The biosensing application is demonstrated by detecting the leaf electric potential; the leaf cells under the microelectrodes are observed because of visible transparency. Furthermore, device integration is demonstrated by electronic circuits with ultrathin and transparent organic transistors. The transistors exhibit white-light illumination stability and mechanical stability to bending stress. These demonstrations provide a basis for developing ultraimperceptible wearable sensor systems with ultrathinness and high visible transmittance."
315,"Objective To count and describe the elements that overlap (ie, present in two or more) and diverge between models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research. Our specific research question was 'what are the elements that underlie models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research?' Design Scoping review. Data sources On 6-7 July 2021, we searched six electronic databases (ie, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence Based Practice Database, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus) and Google Scholar for published literature, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Google, and key agencies' websites for unpublished (ie, grey) literature, with no date restrictions. These searches were supplemented by snowball sampling. Eligibility criteria We included published and unpublished literature that presented (a) models or frameworks (b) of patient engagement (c) in health services research. We excluded articles unavailable as full text or not written in English. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted data from included articles using an a priori developed standardised form. Data were synthesised using both quantitative (ie, counts) and qualitative (ie, mapping) analyses. Results We identified a total of 8069 articles and ultimately included 14 models and frameworks in the review. These models and frameworks were comprised of 18 overlapping and 57 diverging elements, that were organised into six conceptual categories (ie, principles, foundational components, contexts, actions, levels and outcomes) and spanned intrapersonal, interpersonal, process, environmental, and health systems and outcomes domains. Conclusions There is little overlap between the elements that comprise existing models and frameworks of patient engagement in health services research. Those seeking to apply these models and frameworks should consider the 'fit' of each element, by conceptual category and domain, within the context of their study."
316,"Background Multiple voluntary surveillance platforms were developed across the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a real-time understanding of population-based COVID-19 epidemiology. During this time, testing criteria broadened and health-care policies matured. We aimed to test whether there were consistent associations of symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 test status across three surveillance platforms in three countries (two platforms per country), during periods of testing and policy changes. Methods For this observational study, we used data of observations from three volunteer COVID-19 digital surveillance platforms (Carnegie Mellon University and University of Maryland Facebook COVID-19 Symptom Survey, ZOE COVID Symptom Study app, and the Corona Israel study) targeting communities in three countries (Israel, the UK, and the USA; two platforms per country). The study population included adult respondents (age 18-100 years at baseline) who were not health-care workers. We did logistic regression of self-reported symptoms on self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test status (positive or negative), adjusted for age and sex, in each of the study cohorts. We compared odds ratios (ORs) across platforms and countries, and we did meta-analyses assuming a random effects model. We also evaluated testing policy changes, COVID-19 incidence, and time scales of duration of symptoms and symptom to-test time. Findings Between April 1 and July 31, 2020, 514 459 tests from over 10 million respondents were recorded in the six surveillance platform datasets. Anosmia-ageusia was the strongest, most consistent symptom associated with a positive COVID-19 test (robust aggregated rank one, meta-analysed random effects OR 16middot96, 95% CI 13middot13-21middot92). Fever (rank two, 6middot45, 4middot25-9middot81), shortness of breath (rank three, 4middot69, 3middot14-7middot01), and cough (rank four, 4middot29, 3middot13-5middot88) were also highly associated with test positivity. The association of symptoms with test status varied by duration of illness, timing of the test, and broader test criteria, as well as over time, by country, and by platform. Interpretation The strong association of anosmia-ageusia with self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 test was consistently observed, supporting its validity as a reliable COVID-19 signal, regardless of the participatory surveillance platform, country, phase of illness, or testing policy. These findings show that associations between COVID-19 symptoms and test positivity ranked similarly in a wide range of scenarios. Anosmia, fever, and respiratory symptoms consistently had the strongest effect estimates and were the most appropriate empirical signals for symptom-based public health surveillance in areas with insufficient testing or benchmarking capacity. Collaborative syndromic surveillance could enhance real-time epidemiological investigations and public health utility globally.

317,"Many knowledge graphs (KGs) constructed automatically or manually contain noises inevitably when adding heterogeneous data nowadays. The existing methods either have difficulty in detecting noisy triples with conflicted relations or ignore to represent triples after noise elimination, which creates obstacles for the downstream tasks to manipulate KGs. To detect various types of noises in KGs and constitute noise-free triples representation, this paper proposes a high-accuracy KG noise detection method based on path trustworthiness and triple embedding (PTrustE). First, PTrustE constructs a correlation-based path trustworthiness network to learn the global and local features in the path from the head entity to the tail entity of the triple. Next, PTrustE integrates all features of the path into the Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit to learn the path score matrix and path trustworthiness, to keep the sequential nature of paths. Finally, PTrustE uses the path score matrix for triple representation learning and the path trustworthiness for judging whether the triple is correct or not. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of PTrustE. Compared with the second-placed INDIGO, PTrustE offers a 7.1% increase in fMRR on FB15K. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V."
318,"The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated within the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA2 data to support highly collaborative research activities. Its goal is to generate an informed and current understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the iconic cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Initially, reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 available from public databases were integrated into a single, newly created site, www.brcaexchange.org. The purpose of the BRCA Exchange is to provide the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. More than 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number found in the next-largest public database at the project's outset, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases-Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD)-as well as population databases, all linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together the existing international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium expert panel, along with expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, all with a common goal of advancing our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. Ongoing work includes direct contact with national centers with access to BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic data to encourage data sharing, development of methods suitable for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2."
319,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Questions remain about how SARS-CoV-2 impacts pregnant individuals and their children. Objective To expand our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes, regardless of symptomatology, by using serological tests to measure IgG antibody levels. Methods The Generation C Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study conducted at the Mount Sinai Health System. All pregnant individuals receiving obstetrical care at the Mount Sinai Healthcare System from 20 April 2020 onwards are eligible for participation. For the current analysis, we included participants who had given birth to a liveborn singleton infant on or before 22 September 2020. For each woman, we tested the latest prenatal blood sample available to establish seropositivity using a SARS-CoV-2 serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, RT-PCR testing was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab taken during labour. Pregnancy outcomes of interest (i.e., gestational age at delivery, preterm birth, small for gestational age, Apgar scores, maternal and neonatal intensive care unit admission, and length of neonatal hospital stay) and covariates were extracted from medical records. Excluding individuals who tested RT-PCR positive at delivery, we conducted crude and adjusted regression models to compare antibody positive with antibody negative individuals at delivery. We stratified analyses by race/ethnicity to examine potential effect modification. Results The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence based on IgG measurement was 16.4% (95% confidence interval 13.7, 19.3; n=116). Twelve individuals (1.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at delivery. Seropositive individuals were generally younger, more often Black or Hispanic, and more often had public insurance and higher pre-pregnancy BMI compared with seronegative individuals. None of the examined pregnancy outcomes differed by seropositivity, overall or stratified by race/ethnicity. Conclusion Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 without RT-PCR positivity at delivery (suggesting that infection occurred earlier during pregnancy) was not associated with selected adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes among live births in a cohort sample from New York City."
320,"Purpose: This paper aimed to explore the relationship between the different factors, especially health insurance, and the availability of long-term care (LTC) services, among the disabled elderly. Methods: Based on the data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), the logistic regression model was utilized to evaluate the influence of the different factors, especially health insurance, on the availability of long-term care services. Results: Our findings show some interesting results. Firstly, the findings suggest that informal long-term care (LTC) services for elderly persons with disabilities heavily depend on a family member from different health insurance groups. About 80.733% of the disabled elderly depend on a family member as their primary caregivers. Secondly, other influence factors such as income and area of residence were also significantly related to the availability of long-term rental services. Thirdly, Health insurance is a very important factor influencing the availability of Long-term care services both in urban and rural areas (p<0.001) but Income is the most interesting variable. Conclusion: Based on our results, the growth and integration of formal long-term care (LTC) services should be facilitated. Firstly, policymakers can encourage formal long-term care (LTC) services from a variety of sources to work together to increase overall supply capability. Secondly, the long-term living security needs of people who do not have health insurance should be regulated through subsidies according to the economic status."
321,"Therapeutic antibodies are the key treatment option for various cytokine-mediated diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. However, systemic injection of these antibodies can cause side effects and suppress the immune system. Moreover, clearance of therapeutic antibodies from the blood is limiting their efficacy. Here, water-swollen microgels are produced with a size of 25 mu m using droplet-based microfluidics. The microgels are functionalized with TNF alpha antibodies to locally scavenge the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha. Homogeneous distribution of TNF alpha-antibodies is shown throughout the microgel network and demonstrates specific antibody-antigen binding using confocal microscopy and FLIM-FRET measurements. Due to the large internal accessibility of the microgel network, its capacity to bind TNF alpha is extremely high. At a TNF alpha concentration of 2.5 mu g mL(-1), the microgels are able to scavenge 88% of the cytokine. Cell culture experiments reveal the therapeutic potential of these microgels by protecting HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells from TNF alpha toxicity and resulting in a significant reduction of COX II and IL8 production of the cells. When the microgels are incubated with stimulated human macrophages, to mimic the in vivo situation of inflammatory bowel disease, the microgels scavenge almost all TNF alpha that is produced by the cells."
322,"Background Over the past decade, antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens that include integrase strand inhibitors (INSTIs) have become the most commonly used for people with HIV starting ART. Although trials and observational studies have compared virological failure on INSTI-based with other regimens, few data are available on mortality in people with HIV treated with INSTIs in routine care. Therefore, we compared all-cause mortality between different INSTI-based and non-INSTI-based regimens in adults with HIV starting ART from 2013 to 2018. Methods This cohort study used data on people with HIV in Europe and North America from the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) and UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC). We studied the most common third antiretroviral drugs (additional to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) used from 2013 to 2018: rilpivirine, darunavir, raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, efavirenz, and others. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs; adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and other drugs in the regimen) for mortality were estimated using Cox models stratified by ART start year and cohort, with multiple imputation of missing data. Findings 62 500 ART-naive people with HIV starting ART (12 422 [19 center dot 9%] women; median age 38 [IQR 30-48]) were included in the study. 1243 (2 center dot 0%) died during 188 952 person-years of follow-up (median 3 center dot 0 years [IQR 1 center dot 6-4 center dot 4]). There was little evidence that mortality rates differed between regimens with dolutegravir, elvitegravir, rilpivirine, darunavir, or efavirenz as the third drug. However, mortality was higher for raltegravir compared with dolutegravir (aHR 1 center dot 49, 95% CI 1 center dot 15-1 center dot 94), elvitegravir (1 center dot 86, 1 center dot 43-2 center dot 42), rilpivirine (1 center dot 99, 1 center dot 49-2 center dot 66), darunavir (1 center dot 62, 1 center dot 33-1 center dot 98), and efavirenz (2 center dot 12, 1 center dot 60-2 center dot 81) regimens. Results were similar for analyses making different assumptions about missing data and consistent across the time periods 2013-15 and 2016-18. Rates of virological suppression were higher for dolutegravir than other third drugs. Interpretation This large study of patients starting ART since the introduction of INSTIs found little evidence that mortality rates differed between most first-line ART regimens; however, raltegravir-based regimens were associated with higher mortality. Although unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded as an explanation for our findings, virological benefits of first-line INSTIs-based ART might not translate to differences in mortality.

323,"Objective: To investigate the characteristics and outcomes of people who initiated different antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens during the era of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Design: UK-based observational cohort study. Methods: UK Collaborative HIV Cohort study participants were included if they had started ART between 1 January 2012 and 30 June 2017. Virological failure was defined as the first of two consecutive plasma HIV RNA more than 50 copies/ml, at least 6 months after starting ART. Follow-up was censored at ART discontinuation, class switch or death. The risk of virological failure among those on INSTI, protease inhibitor or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) regimens was compared using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. Results: Of 12 585 participants, 45.6% started a NNRTI, 29.0% a protease inhibitor and 25.4% an INSTI regimen. Over a median follow-up of 20.3 months (interquartile range 7.9-38.9), 7.5% of participants experienced virological failure. Compared with those starting an NNRTI regimen, people receiving INSTIs or protease inhibitors were more likely to experience virological failure: INSTI group adjusted hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.95, P = 0.0009; protease inhibitor group adjusted hazard ratio 2.70, 95% confidence interval 2.27-3.21, P less than 0.0001, likelihood ratio test P less than 0.0001. Conclusion: First-line INSTI regimens were associated with a lower risk of virological failure than protease inhibitor regimens but both groups were more likely to experience virological failure than those initiating treatment with a NNRTI. There is likely to be residual channelling bias resulting from selected use of INSTIs and protease inhibitors in specific clinical contexts, including in those with a perceived risk of poor adherence.

Methods A total of 160 patients with pathologically confirmed breast IDC (training cohort: n = 112; validation cohort: n = 48) who underwent preoperative breast MRI were included. Imaging features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (cT1WI) sequences. A four-step procedure was applied for feature selection and radiomics signature building. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the features associated with LVI, which were then incorporated into the radiomics nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on the two radiomics models were used to estimate disease-free survival (DFS). Results The fusion radiomics signature of the T2WI, cT1WI, and ADC maps achieved a better predictive efficacy for LVI than either of them alone. The proposed radiomics nomogram, incorporating the fusion radiomics signature and MRI-reported peritumoral edema, showed satisfactory capabilities of calibration and discrimination in both training and validation datasets, with AUCs of 0.919 (95% CI: 0.871-0.967) and 0.863 (95% CI: 0.726-0.999), respectively. The radiomics signature and nomogram-defined high-risk groups had a shorter DFS than those in the low-risk groups (both p < 0.05). Higher Rad-scores were independently associated with a worse DFS in the whole cohort (p < 0.05). Conclusions The proposed nomogram, incorporating multiparametric MRI-based radiomics signature and MRI-reported peritumoral edema, achieved a satisfactory preoperative prediction of LVI and clinical outcomes in IDC patients."
325,"BACKGROUND Although the three vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) that have received emergency use authorization in the United States are highly effective, breakthrough infections are occurring. Data are needed on the serial use of homologous boosters (same as the primary vaccine) and heterologous boosters (different from the primary vaccine) in fully vaccinated recipients. METHODS In this phase 1-2, open-label clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States, adults who had completed a Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier and had no reported history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines: mRNA-1273 (Moderna) at a dose of 100 mu g, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson-Janssen) at a dose of 5x10(10) virus particles, or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) at a dose of 30 mu g. The primary end points were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on trial days 15 and 29. RESULTS Of the 458 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.COV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 as booster vaccines; 1 participant did not receive the assigned vaccine. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. More than half the recipients reported having injection-site pain, malaise, headache, or myalgia. For all combinations, antibody neutralizing titers against a SARS-CoV-2 D614G pseudovirus increased by a factor of 4 to 73, and binding titers increased by a factor of 5 to 55. Homologous boosters increased neutralizing antibody titers by a factor of 4 to 20, whereas heterologous boosters increased titers by a factor of 6 to 73. Spike-specific T-cell responses increased in all but the homologous Ad26.COV2.S-boosted subgroup. CD8+ T-cell levels were more durable in the Ad26.COV2.S-primed recipients, and heterologous boosting with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine substantially increased spike-specific CD8+ T cells in the mRNA vaccine recipients. CONCLUSIONS Homologous and heterologous booster vaccines had an acceptable safety profile and were immunogenic in adults who had completed a primary Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier."
326,"Radiolabelled (bio)molecules have advanced many areas of science from fundamental biology to human health including applications in molecular imaging and more generally nuclear medicine. Today, the field of radiochemistry is rapidly expanding, a trend resulting from the increasing demand for labelled molecules necessary for diagnosis and to accelerate pharmaceutical drug development. More often, the synthesis of labelled (bio)molecules employs a pre-functionalised precursor to allow for the chemoselective installation of a particular radioisotope-containing substituent. Among the array of precursors available, boron reagents occupy a prominent place because they are easy to handle, numerous possibilities exist for their preparation, and their reactivity has been well studied especially in cross-coupling chemistry. In this review, we discuss the value of boron-based precursors for the radiolabelling of (bio)molecules with the radionuclides carbon-11, fluorine-18, iodine-123, iodine-125 and iodine-131, and we illustrate how these radiosynthetic advances have opened the radiochemical space available for areas such as PET and SPECT imaging."
327,"Electronic skins (e-skins) have the potential to turn into breakthroughs in biomedical applications. Herein, a novel acellular dermal matrix (ADM)-based bioelectronic skin (e-ADM) is used to fabricate versatile wound therapy-health monitoring tissue-nanoengineered skin scaffolds via a facile one-pot bio-compositing strategy to incorporate the conductive carbon nanotubes and self-assembled micro-copper oxide microspheres with a cicada-wing-like rough surface and nanocone microstructure. The e-ADM exhibits robust tensile strength (22 MPa), flexibility, biodegradability, electroactivity, and antibacterial properties. Interestingly, e-ADM exhibits the pH-responsive ability for intelligent command between sterilization and wound repair . Additionally, e-ADM enables accurate real-time monitoring of human activities, providing a novel flexible e-skin sensor to record injury and motions. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that with electrical stimulation, e-ADM could prominently facilitate cell growth and proliferation and further promote full-thickness skin wound healing, providing a comprehensive therapeutic strategy for smart sensing and tissue repair, guiding the development of high-performance wound therapy-health monitoring bioelectronic skin-scaffolds."
328,"Background: To investigate the ability of the CT-based radiomics models for pretreatment prediction of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC).Methods: This retrospective analysis included 279 consecutive LAGC patients from center I (training cohort, n = 196; internal validation cohort, n = 83) who were examined by contrast-enhanced CT before treatment and 211 consecutive patients from center II who were recruited as an external validation cohort. A total of 102 features were extracted from the portal venous phase CT images, and feature selection was further subjected to three-step procedures. Next, five classifications, including Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes, Random forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithms, were applied to construct radiomics models for predicting the good-responder (GR) to NAC in the training cohort. The prediction performances were evaluated using ROC and decision curve analysis (DCA).Results: No statistically significant difference was detected for all clinicopathological characteristics. Additionally, all six key features were significantly different between GR and poor-responder (PR). Compared to models from other classifiers, the model obtained with XGB showed promising prediction performance with the highest AUC of 0.790(95%CI: 0.700-0.880) in the training cohort. The corresponding AUCs were 0.784(95%CI, 0.659-0.908) and 0.803(95%CI, 0.717-0.888) in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. DCA confirmed the clinical utility.Conclusions: The proposed pretreatment CT-based radiomics models revealed good performances in predicting response to NAC and thus may be used to improve clinical treatment in LAGC patients.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

329,"BackgroundAspirin is widely used for cardioprotection with its antiplatelet effects due to the blocking of thromboxane A2 production. However, it has been suggested that platelet abnormalities in those with diabetes prevent adequate suppression with once daily aspirin.MethodsIn the ASCEND randomized double-blind trial of aspirin 100 mg once daily versus placebo in participants with diabetes but no history of cardiovascular disease, suppression was assessed by measuring 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 excretion in urine (U-TXM) in a randomly selected sample of 152 participants (76 aspirin arm, 74 placebo arm), plus 198 (93 aspirin arm, 105 placebo arm) adherent to study drugs and selected to maximize the numbers ingesting their last tablet 12-24 h before urine sampling. U-TXM was assayed using a competitive ELISA assay in samples mailed a mean of 2 years after randomization, with time since taking last aspirin/placebo tablet recorded at the time of sample provision. Effective suppression (U-TXM < 1500 pg/mg creatinine) and percentage reductions in U-TXM by aspirin allocation were compared.ResultsIn the random sample, U-TXM was 71% (95% CI 64-76%) lower among aspirin vs placebo-allocated participants. Among adherent participants in the aspirin arm, U-TXM was 72% (95% CI 69-75%) lower than in the placebo arm and 77% achieved effective suppression overall. Suppression was similar among those who ingested their last tablet more than 12 h before urine sampling with levels in the aspirin arm 72% (95% CI 67-77%) lower than in the placebo arm and 70% achieving effective suppression.ConclusionsDaily aspirin significantly reduces U-TXM in participants with diabetes, including at 12-24 h after ingestion."
330,"Osteoporosis (OP) is the most common orthopedic disease in the elderly and the main cause of age-related mortality and disability. However, no satisfactory intervention is currently available in clinical practice. Thus, an effective therapy to prevent or delay the development of OP should be devised. Osteoclastogenesis overactivation and excessive bone resorption are the main characteristics of OP. Accordingly, a paradigm for nanozyme-mediated normalization of the disease microenvironment to regulate osteoclast differentiation and delay OP is proposed. Hollow Prussian blue nanozymes (HPBZs) are prepared via template-free hydrothermal synthesis and selected as representative nanozymes. The intrinsic osteoclast activity-remodeling bioactivities of the HPBZs are explored in vitro and in vivo, focusing on their impact on osteogenesis and specific molecular mechanisms using an OP murine model. The HPBZs significantly normalize the OP microenvironment, thereby inhibiting osteoclast formation and osteoclast resorption, possibly owing to the suppression of intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, the mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways. Consistently, in an ovariectomy-induced OP murine model, HPBZ treatment significantly attenuates osteoporotic bone loss in vivo. The findings confirm the HPBZ-mediated normalization of the disease microenvironment for the treatment of OP and suggest its application to other inflammation-related diseases."
331,"IMPORTANCE Assessing booster effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine over longer time intervals and in response to any further SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial in determining optimal COVID-19 vaccination strategies. OBJECTIVE To determine levels of protection against severe COVID-19 and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by types and combinations of vaccine boosters in Singapore during the Omicron wave. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study included Singapore residents aged 30 years or more vaccinated with either at least 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (ie, Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Sinovac CoronaVac or Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV) as of March 10, 2022. Individuals with a known SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to December 27, 2021, an infection on or before the date of their second vaccine dose, or with reinfection cases were excluded. EXPOSURES Two or 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, Sinovac CoronaVac, or Sinopharm BBIBP-CorV. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Notified infections from December 27, 2021, to March 10, 2022, adjusted for age, sex, race, housing status, and calendar days. Estimated booster effectiveness, defined as the relative incidence-rate reduction of severe disease (supplemental oxygen, intensive care, or death) or confirmed infection following 3-dose vaccination compared with 5 months after second mRNA dose, was determined using binomial regression. RESULTS Among 2 441 581 eligible individuals (1 279 047 [52.4%] women, 846 110 (34.7%) aged 60 years and older), there were 319 943 (13.1%) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, of which 1513 (0.4%) were severe COVID-19 cases. mRNA booster effectiveness against confirmed infection 15 to 60 days after boosting was estimated to range from 31.7% to 41.3% for the 4 boosting combinations (homologous BNT162b2, homologous mRNA-1273, 2-dose BNT162b2/mRNA-1273 booster, and 2-dose mRNA-1273/BNT162b2 booster). Five months and more after boosting, estimated booster effectiveness against confirmed infection waned, ranging from -2.8% to 14.6%. Against severe COVID-19, estimated mRNA booster effectiveness was 87.4%(95% CI, 83.3%-90.5%) 15 to 60 days after boosting and 87.2%(95% CI, 84.2%-89.7%) 5 to 6 months after boosting, with no significant difference comparing vaccine combinations. Booster effectiveness against severe COVID-19 15 days to 330 days after 3-dose inactivated COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of combination, was estimated to be 69.6%(95% CI, 48.7%-81.9%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Booster mRNA vaccine protection against severe COVID-19 was estimated to be durable over 6 months. Three-dose inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provided greater protection than 2-dose but weaker protection compared with 3-dose mRNA."
332,"Monitoring the concentration of useful biomarkers via electronic skins (e-skins) is highly important for the development of wearable health management systems. While some biosensor e-skins with high flexibility, sensitivity, and stability have been developed, little attention has been paid to their long-term comfortability and optical transparency. Here, a conformable, gas permeable, and transparent skin-like Cu2O@Ni micromesh structural glucose monitoring patch is reported. With its self-supporting micromesh structure, the skin-like glucose monitoring patch exhibits excellent shape conformability, high gas permeability, and high optical transmittance. The skin-like glucose biosensor achieves real-time monitoring of glucose concentrations with high sensitivity (15 420 mu A cm(-2)mM(-1)), low detection limit (50 nM), fast response time (-2 s), high selectivity, and long-term stability. These desirable performance properties arise from the synergistic effects of the self-supporting micromesh configuration, high conductivity of the metallic Ni micromesh, and high electrocatalytic activities of the Cu2O toward glucose. This work presents a versatile and efficient strategy for constructing conformable, gas permeable, and transparent biosensor e-skins with excellent practicability towards wearable electronics."
333,"The analysis of spontaneous EEG activity and evoked potentials is a cornerstone of the instrumental evaluation of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). The past few years have witnessed an unprecedented surge in EEG-related research applied to the prediction and detection of recovery of consciousness after severe brain injury, opening up the prospect that new concepts and tools may be available at the bedside. This paper provides a comprehensive, critical overview of both consolidated and investigational electrophysiological techniques for the prognostic and diagnostic assessment of DoC. We describe conventional clinical EEG approaches, then focus on evoked and event-related potentials, and finally we analyze the potential of novel research findings. In doing so, we (i) draw a distinction between acute, prolonged and chronic phases of DoC, (ii) attempt to relate both clinical and research findings to the underlying neuronal processes and (iii) discuss technical and conceptual caveats. The primary aim of this narrative review is to bridge the gap between standard and emerging electrophysiological measures for the detection and prediction of recovery of consciousness. The ultimate scope is to provide a reference and common ground for academic researchers active in the field of neurophysiology and clinicians engaged in intensive care unit and rehabilitation.

334,"This work demonstrates how computational and physical modelling of the positron emission tomography (PET) image acquisition process for a state-of-the-art integrated PET and magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MR) system can produce images comparable to the manufacturer. The GE SIGNA PET/MR scanner is manufactured by General Electric and has time-of-flight (TOF) capabilities of about 390 ps. All software development took place in the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR: http://stir.sf.net) library, which is a widely used open source software to reconstruct data as exported from emission tomography scanners. The new software developments will be integrated into STIR, providing the opportunity for researchers worldwide to establish and expand their image reconstruction methods. Furthermore, this work is of particular significance as it provides the first validation of TOF PET image reconstruction for real scanner datasets using the STIR library. This paper presents the methodology, analysis, and critical issues encountered in implementing an independent reconstruction software package. Acquired PET data were processed via several appropriate algorithms which are necessary to produce an accurate and precise quantitative image. This included mathematical, physical and anatomical modelling of the patient and simulation of various aspects of the acquisition. These included modelling of random coincidences using 'singles' rates per crystals, detector efficiencies and geometric effects. Attenuation effects were calculated by using the STIR's attenuation correction model. Modelling all these effects within the system matrix allowed the reconstruction of PET images which demonstrates the metabolic uptake of the administered radiopharmaceutical. These implementations were validated using measured phantom and clinical datasets. The developments are tested using the ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) and the more recently proposed kernelised expectation maximisation (KEM) algorithm which incorporates anatomical information from MR images into PET reconstruction."
335,"This study aimed to describe the topographic variation of the macula's choroidal angioarchitecture using three-dimensional (3D) choroidal vascularity index (CVI) of healthy eyes from an Asian population and to investigate the associations of CVI. 50 participants were recruited via stratified randomisation based on subfoveal choroidal thickness from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases Study. Macular volume scans were acquired using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography with enhanced depth imaging. CVI was assessed based on B-scan binarisation and choroid segmentation. The 3D CVI of the whole, superior, central, and inferior macula were 62.92 +/- 1.57%, 62.75 +/- 1.93%, 63.35 +/- 1.72%, and 62.66 +/- 1.70%, respectively, pairwise comparisons P all > 0.05). 3D CVI (Whole Macula) and 2D CVI (Subfoveal) were associated only with each other and not with other ocular and systemic factors. 2D CVI (Subfoveal) had a moderate agreement with 3D CVI (Central Macula) [intraclass corelation coefficient (ICC) = 0.719], and had poorer agreement with 3D CVI of the whole macula, superior, and inferior macula (ICC = 0.591, 0.483, and 0.394, respectively). Scanning volume did not influence 3D CVI measurements. In conclusion, 3D CVI demonstrated no significant topographic variation. CVI was not correlated with demographic or ocular structural features. 2D CVI of the fovea is partially representative of 3D CVI of the macula."
336,"Objective: To investigate the potential value of radiomics features based on preoperative multiparameter MRI in predicting disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with local advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Methods: We identified 234 patients with LARC who underwent preoperative MRI, including T2-weighted, diffusion kurtosis imaging, and contrast enhanced T1-weighted. All patients were randomly divided into the training (n = 164) and validation (n = 70) cohorts. 414 features were extracted from the tumor from above sequences and the radiomics signature was then generated, mainly based on feature stability and Cox proportional hazards model. Two models, integrating pre- and postoperative variables, were constructed to validate the radiomics signatures for DFS estimation. Results: The radiomics signature, composed of six DFS-related features, was significantly associated with DFS in the training and validation cohorts (both p < 0.001). The radiomics signature and MR-defined extramural venous invasion (mrEMVI) were identified as the independent predictor of DFS both in the pre- and postoperative models. In both cohorts, the two radiomics-based models exhibited better prediction performance (C-index >= 0.77, all p < 0.05) than the corresponding clinical models, with positive net reclassification improvement and lower Akaike information criterion (AIC). Decision curve analysis also confirmed their clinical usefulness. The radiomics-based models could categorize LARC patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct profiles of DFS (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: The proposed radiomics models with pre- and postoperative features have the potential to predict DFS, and may provide valuable guidance for the future individualized management in patients with LARC.

337,"Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate whether lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) use following detection of M184V/I is associated with better virological outcomes. Methods We identified people with viruses harbouring the M184V/I mutation in UK multicentre data sets who had treatment change/initiation within 1 year. We analysed outcomes of viral suppression (< 200 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) and appearance of new major drug resistance mutations (DRMs) using Cox and Poisson models, with stratification by new drug regimen (excluding 3TC/FTC) and Bayesian implementation, and estimated the effect of 3TC/FTC adjusted for individual and viral characteristics. Results We included 2597 people with the M184V/I resistance mutation, of whom 665 (25.6%) were on 3TC and 458 (17.6%) on FTC. We found a negative adjusted association between 3TC/FTC use and viral suppression [hazard ratio (HR) 0.84; 95% credibility interval (CrI) 0.71-0.98]. On subgroup analysis of individual drugs, there was no evidence of an association with viral suppression for 3TC (n = 184; HR 0.94; 95% CrI 0.73-1.15) or FTC (n = 454; HR 0.99; 95% CrI 0.80-1.19) amongst those on tenofovir-containing regimens, but we estimated a reduced rate of viral suppression for people on 3TC amongst those without tenofovir use (n = 481; HR 0.71; 95% CrI 0.54-0.90). We found no association between 3TC/FTC and detection of any new DRM (overall HR 0.92; 95% CrI 0.64-1.18), but found inconclusive evidence of a lower incidence rate of new DRMs (overall incidence rate ratio 0.69; 95% CrI 0.34-1.11). Conclusions We did not find evidence that 3TC or FTC use is associated with an increase in viral suppression, but it may reduce the appearance of additional DRMs in people with M184V/I. 3TC was associated with reduced viral suppression amongst people on regimens without tenofovir."
338,"Purpose: To evaluate the demographic and imaging factors at baseline and Month 3 (M3) that predict visual or anatomical responses at Month 12 (M12) in the EVEREST-II study for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of 322 participants in the EVEREST-II study. Patient factors, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), treatment, and imaging parameters at baseline and M3 were evaluated with respect to outcomes at M12 using univariate and multivariable analysis. Results: Younger age (P < 0.001) and lower baseline BCVA (P < 0.001) were associated with higher BCVA gains at M12. Smaller baseline polypoidal lesion area was associated with higher BCVA gains at M12 only in the ranibizumab monotherapy arm (P = 0.008). Central subfield thickness at M3, area of branching vascular network at M3, BCVA at M3, and age were associated with change in BCVA from M3 at M12. Higher odds of fluid-free retina at M12 were associated with lower baseline central subfield thickness (P = 0.006), treatment with combination therapy (baseline and M3 models; P < 0.001), and absence of subretinal fluid at M3 (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Several imaging parameters at baseline and M3 can predict treatment outcome. The interaction between treatment arm and total polypoidal lesion area suggests this feature may assist selecting between initial ranibizumab monotherapy or combination therapy."
339,"Objectives To assess the association between routinely prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and deaths from COVID-19 using OpenSAFELY, a secure analytical platform. Methods We conducted two cohort studies from 1 March to 14 June 2020. Working on behalf of National Health Service England, we used routine clinical data in England linked to death data. In study 1, we identified people with an NSAID prescription in the last 3 years from the general population. In study 2, we identified people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis. We defined exposure as current NSAID prescription within the 4 months before 1 March 2020. We used Cox regression to estimate HRs for COVID-19 related death in people currently prescribed NSAIDs, compared with those not currently prescribed NSAIDs, accounting for age, sex, comorbidities, other medications and geographical region. Results In study 1, we included 536 423 current NSAID users and 1 927 284 non-users in the general population. We observed no evidence of difference in risk of COVID-19 related death associated with current use (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.14) in the multivariable-adjusted model. In study 2, we included 1 708 781 people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis, of whom 175 495 (10%) were current NSAID users. In the multivariable-adjusted model, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 related death (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94) associated with current use of NSAID versus non-use. Conclusions We found no evidence of a harmful effect of routinely prescribed NSAIDs on COVID-19 related deaths. Risks of COVID-19 do not need to influence decisions about the routine therapeutic use of NSAIDs."
340,"Background. Analytical treatment interruptions (ATIs) are essential in research on HIV cure. However, the heterogeneity of virological outcome measures used in different trials hinders the interpretation of the efficacy of different strategies. Methods. We conducted a retrospective analysis of viral load (VL) evolution in 334 ATI episodes in chronic HIV-1-infected patients collected from 11 prospective studies. Quantitative (baseline VL, set point, delta set point, VL, and delta VL at given weeks after ATI, peak VL, delta peak VL, and area under the rebound curve) and temporal parameters (time to rebound [TtR], set point, peak, and certain absolute and relative VL thresholds) were described. Pairwise correlations between parameters were analyzed, and potential confounding factors (sex, age, time of known HIV infection, time on ART, and immunological interventions) were evaluated. Results. The set point was lower than baseline VL (median delta set point, -0.26; P < .001). This difference was >1 log10 copies/mL in 13.9% of the cases. The median TtR was 2 weeks; no patients had an undetectable VL at week 12. The median time to set point was 8 weeks: by week 12, 97.4% of the patients had reached the set point. TtR and baseline VL were correlated with most temporal and quantitative parameters. The variables independently associated with TtR were baseline VL and the use of immunological interventions. Conclusions. TtR could be an optimal surrogate marker of response in HIV cure strategies. Our results underline the importance of taking into account baseline VL and other confounding factors in the design and interpretation of these studies."
341,"Natural-killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is the most common extranodal lymphoma with highly aggressive clinical outcome. System biology techniques provide novel insights into the pathogenesis, risk stratification, and clinical management in NKTCL. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis reveal most frequent deletion of chromosome 6q21. Whole-exome sequencing studies identify recurrent somatic gene mutations, involving RNA helicases, tumor suppressors, JAK-STAT pathway molecules, and epigenetic modifiers. Genome-wide association study reports strongest association of HLA-DPB1 rs9277378 with lymphomagenesis. Alterations of oncogenic signaling pathways as well as epigenetic dysregulation of microRNA and long non-coding RNAs are also observed in NKTCL. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the major etiology of NKTCL and the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. Different risk stratification models are proposed based on clinical parameters (IPI, PINK, and PINK-E, etc.) or biomarkers (Ki67, C-reactive protein level, and EBV DNA, etc.). Therapeutic strategies vary according to disease stage, including radiotherapy, asparaginase-based chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, targeted therapy (immune checkpoints inhibitors, and histone deacetylation inhibitors, etc.). Future investigations will be emphasized on EBV-related pathogenesis of NKTCL, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers, as well as multi-center clinical trials, so as to optimize personalized treatment of NKTCL in the era of precision medicine."
342,"Background: Substantial interindividual variability exists in the maximal rate of fat oxidation (MFO) during exercise with potential implications for metabolic health. Although the diet can affect the metabolic response to exercise, the contribution of a self-selected diet to the interindividual variability in the MFO requires further clarification. Objective: We sought to identify whether recent, self-selected dietary intake independently predicts the MFO in healthy men and women. Design: The MFO and maximal oxygen uptake ((V) over dot O-2 max) were determined with the use of indirect calorimetry in 305 healthy volunteers [150 men and 155 women; mean +/- SD age: 25 +/- 6 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 23 +/- 2]. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to assess body composition with the self-reported physical activity level (SRPAL) and dietary intake determined in the 4 d before exercise testing. To minimize potential confounding with typically observed sex-related differences (e.g., body composition), predictor variables were mean-centered by sex. In the analyses, hierarchical multiple linear regressions were used to quantify each variable's influence on the MFO. Results: The mean absolute MFO was 0.55 +/- 0.19 g/min (range: 0.19-1.13 g/min). A total of 44.4% of the interindividual variability in the MFO was explained by the (V) over dot O-2 max, sex, and SRPAL with dietary carbohydrate (carbohydrate; negative association with the MFO) and fat intake (positive association) associated with an additional 3.2% of the variance. When expressed relative to fat-free mass (FFM), the MFO was 10.8 +/- 3.2 mg . kg FFM (-1). min (-1) (range: 3.5-20.7 mg . kg FFM (-1) . min (-1)) with 16.6% of the variability explained by the (V) over dot O-2 max, sex, and SRPAL; dietary carbohydrate and fat intakes together explained an additional 2.6% of the variability. Biological sex was an independent determinant of the MFO with women showing a higher MFO [men: 10.3 +/- 3.1 mg . kg FFM (-1) . min 21 (3.5-19.9 mg . kg FFM-1 . min-(1)); women: 11.2 6 3.3 mg . kg FFM-1 . min 21 (4.6-20.7 mg.kg FFM-1 . min(-1)); P < 0.05]. Conclusion: Considered alongside other robust determinants, dietary carbohydrate and fat intake make modest but independent contributions to the interindividual variability in the capacity to oxidize fat during exercise."
343,"Objective To track the interplay between (micro-) structural changes along the trajectories of nociceptive pathways and its relation to the presence and intensity of neuropathic pain (NP) after spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods A quantitative neuroimaging approach employing a multiparametric mapping protocol was used, providing indirect measures of myelination (via contrasts such as magnetisation transfer (MT) saturation, longitudinal relaxation (R1)) and iron content (via effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*)) was used to track microstructural changes within nociceptive pathways. In order to characterise concurrent changes along the entire neuroaxis, a combined brain and spinal cord template embedded in the statistical parametric mapping framework was used. Multivariate source-based morphometry was performed to identify naturally grouped patterns of structural variation between individuals with and without NP after SCI. Results In individuals with NP, lower R1 and MT values are evident in the primary motor cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while increases in R2* are evident in the cervical cord, periaqueductal grey (PAG), thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex when compared with pain-free individuals. Lower R1 values in the PAG and greater R2* values in the cervical cord are associated with NP intensity. Conclusions The degree of microstructural changes across ascending and descending nociceptive pathways is critically implicated in the maintenance of NP. Tracking maladaptive plasticity unravels the intimate relationships between neurodegenerative and compensatory processes in NP states and may facilitate patient monitoring during therapeutic trials related to pain and neuroregeneration."
344,"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effectors that lyse virally infected and tumorigenic cells through the formation of an immunological synapse. Actin remodeling at the lytic immunological synapse is a critical requirement for multiple facets of cytotoxic function. Activating receptor and integrin signaling leads to the regulated turnover and remodeling of actin, which is required for adhesion, sustained receptor signaling, and ultimately exocytosis. NK cells undergo lytic granule exocytosis in hypodense regions of a pervasive actin network. Although these requirements have been well demonstrated, neither the dynamic regulation of synaptic actin nor its specific function, however, has been determined at a nanoscale level. Here, live-cell super-resolution microscopy demonstrates nanoscale filamentous actin dynamism in NK cell lytic granule secretion. Following cell spreading, the overall content of the branched actin network at an immune synapse is stable over time and contains branched actin fibers and discrete actin foci. Similar actin architecture is generated in cytolytic T cells, although the timescale differs from that of NK cells. Individual filament displacement leads to stochastic clearance formation and disappearance, which are independent of lytic granule positioning. Actin dynamism is dependent upon branched network formation mediated by Arp2/3 and contractility generated by myosin IIA. Importantly, the use of small-molecule inhibitors demonstrates that actin dynamism is ultimately needed for granule secretion. Thus, we describe a requirement for nanoscale actin fiber rearrangement in generating the complex actin architecture that enables lytic granule secretion."
345,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular arrhythmia deriving from uncoordinated electrical activation with considerable associated morbidity and mortality. To expand the limited understanding of AF biological mechanisms, we performed two screenings, investigating the genetic and metabolic determinants of AF in the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol study. We found 110 AF cases out of 10,509 general population individuals. A genome-wide association scan (GWAS) identified two novel loci (p-value < 5 x 10(-8)) around SNPs rs745582874, next to gene PBX1, and rs768476991, within gene PCCA, with genotype calling confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Risk alleles at both SNPs were enriched in a family detected through familial aggregation analysis of the phenotype, and both rare alleles co-segregated with AF. The metabolic screening of 175 metabolites, in a subset of individuals, revealed a 41% lower concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine lysoPC a C20:3 in AF cases compared to controls (p-adj = 0.005). The genetic findings, combined with previous evidence, indicate that the two identified GWAS loci may be considered novel genetic rare determinants for AF. Considering additionally the association of lysoPC a C20:3 with AF by metabolic screening, our results demonstrate the valuable contribution of the combined genomic and metabolomic approach in studying AF in large-scale population studies."
346,"Metabolomics in human serum samples provide a snapshot of the current metabolic state of an individuum. Metabolite concentrations are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Concentrations of certain metabolites can further depend on age, sex, menopause, and diet of study participants. A better understanding of these relationships is pivotal for the planning of metabolomics studies involving human subjects and interpretation of their results. We generated one of the largest single-site targeted metabolomics data sets consisting of 175 quantified metabolites in 6872 study participants. We identified metabolites significantly associated with age, sex, body mass index, diet, and menopausal status. While most of our results agree with previous large-scale studies, we also found novel associations including serotonin as a sex and BMI-related metabolite and sarcosine and C2 carnitine showing significantly higher concentrations in post-menopausal women. Finally, we observed strong associations between higher consumption of food items and certain metabolites, mostly phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines. Most, and the strongest, relationships were found for habitual meat intake while no significant relationships were found for most fruits, vegetables, and grain products. Summarizing, our results reconfirm findings from previous population-based studies on an independent cohort. Together, these findings will ultimately enable the consolidation of sets of metabolites which are related to age, sex, BMI, and menopause as well as to participants' diet."
347,"Background Progesterone administration has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth and neonatal morbidity in women at high risk, but there is uncertainty about longer term effects on the child. Methods We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of vaginal progesterone, 200 mg daily taken from 22-24 to 34 weeks of gestation, on pregnancy and infant outcomes in women at risk of preterm birth (because of previous spontaneous birth at <= 34 weeks and 0 days of gestation, or a cervical length <= 25 mm, or because of a positive fetal fibronectin test combined with other clinical risk factors for preterm birth [any one of a history in a previous pregnancy of preterm birth, second trimester loss, preterm premature fetal membrane rupture, or a history of a cervical procedure to treat abnormal smears]). The objective of the study was to determine whether vaginal progesterone prophylaxis given to reduce the risk of preterm birth affects neonatal and childhood outcomes. We defined three primary outcomes: fetal death or birth before 34 weeks and 0 days gestation (obstetric), a composite of death, brain injury, or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (neonatal), and a standardised cognitive score at 2 years of age (childhood), imputing values for deaths. Randomisation was done through a web portal, with participants, investigators, and others involved in giving the intervention, assessing outcomes, or analysing data masked to treatment allocation until the end of the study. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ISRCTN. com, number ISRCTN14568373. Findings Between Feb 2, 2009, and April 12, 2013, we randomly assigned 1228 women to the placebo group (n=610) and the progesterone group (n=618). In the placebo group, data from 597, 587, and 439 women or babies were available for analysis of obstetric, neonatal, and childhood outcomes, respectively; in the progesterone group the corresponding numbers were 600, 589, and 430. After correction for multiple outcomes, progesterone had no significant effect on the primary obstetric outcome (odds ratio adjusted for multiple comparisons [OR] 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.22) or neonatal outcome (OR 0.62, 0.38-1.03), nor on the childhood outcome (cognitive score, progesterone group vs placebo group, 97.3 [SD 17.9] vs 97.7 [17.5]; difference in means -0.48, 95% CI -2.77 to 1.81). Maternal or child serious adverse events were reported in 70 (11%) of 610 patients in the placebo group and 59 (10%) of 616 patients in the progesterone group (p=0.27). Interpretation Vaginal progesterone was not associated with reduced risk of preterm birth or composite neonatal adverse outcomes, and had no long-term benefit or harm on outcomes in children at 2 years of age.

348,"Objectives: Electronic health records offer the opportunity to discover new clinical implications for established blood tests, but international comparisons have been lacking. We tested the association of total white cell count (WBC) with all-cause mortality in England and New Zealand. Setting: Primary care practices in England (ClinicAl research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records (CALIBER)) and New Zealand (PREDICT). Design: Analysis of linked electronic health record data sets: CALIBER (primary care, hospitalisation, mortality and acute coronary syndrome registry) and PREDICT (cardiovascular risk assessments in primary care, hospitalisations, mortality, dispensed medication and laboratory results). Participants: People aged 30-75 years with no prior cardiovascular disease (CALIBER: N=686 475, 92.0% white; PREDICT: N=194 513, 53.5% European, 14.7% Pacific, 13.4% Maori), followed until death, transfer out of practice (in CALIBER) or study end. Primary outcome measure: HRs for mortality were estimated using Cox models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, ethnicity and total: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio. Results: We found 'J'-shaped associations between WBC and mortality; the second quintile was associated with lowest risk in both cohorts. High WBC within the reference range (8.65-10.05x10(9)/L) was associated with significantly increased mortality compared to the middle quintile (6.25-7.25x10(9)/L); adjusted HR 1.51 (95% CI 1.43 to 1.59) in CALIBER and 1.33 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.65) in PREDICT. WBC outside the reference range was associated with even greater mortality. The association was stronger over the first 6 months of follow-up, but similar across ethnic groups. Conclusions: Clinically recorded WBC within the range considered 'normal' is associated with mortality in ethnically different populations from two countries, particularly within the first 6 months. Large-scale international comparisons of electronic health record cohorts might yield new insights from widely performed clinical tests."
349,"Neuroblastoma is a solid, neuroendocrine tumor with divergent clinical behavior ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. The diverse clinical presentations of neuroblastoma are directly linked to the high intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity it presents. This heterogeneity is strongly associated with therapeutic resistance and continuous relapses, often leading to fatal outcomes. The development of successful risk assessment and tailored treatment strategies lies in evaluating the extent of heterogeneity via the accurate genetic and epigenetic profiling of distinct cell subpopulations present in the tumor. Recent studies have focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive tumoral heterogeneity in pursuing better therapeutic and diagnostic approaches. This review describes the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic aspects of neuroblastoma heterogeneity. In addition, we summarize the recent findings on three crucial factors that can lead to heterogeneity in solid tumors: the inherent diversity of the progenitor cells, the presence of cancer stem cells, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment."
350,"Over the past few decades, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitoustool in basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, no reference standards currently exist to quantify individual differences in neuroimaging metrics overtime, in contrast to growth charts for anthropometric traits such as height and weight(1). Here we assemble an interactive open resource to benchmark brain morphology derived from any current or future sample of MRI data (http://www.brainchart.io/). With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100 years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories(2) of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones(3), showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes."
351,"The Comprehensive Resistance Prediction for Tuberculosis: an International Consortium (CRyPTIC) presents here a data compendium of 12,289 Mycobacterium tuberculosis global clinical isolates, all of which have undergone whole-genome sequencing and have had their minimum inhibitory concentrations to 13 antitubercular drugs measured in a single assay. It is the largest matched phenotypic and genotypic dataset for M. tuberculosis to date. Here, we provide a summary detailing the breadth of data collected, along with a description of how the isolates were selected, collected, and uniformly processed in CRyPTIC partner laboratories across 23 countries. The compendium contains 6,814 isolates resistant to at least 1 drug, including 2,129 samples that fully satisfy the clinical definitions of rifampicin resistant (RR), multidrug resistant (MDR), pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR), or extensively drug resistant (XDR). The data are enriched for rare resistance-associated variants, and the current limits of genotypic prediction of resistance status (sensitive/resistant) are presented by using a genetic mutation catalogue, along with the presence of suspected resistance-conferring mutations for isolates resistant to the newly introduced drugs bedaquiline, clofazimine, delamanid, and linezolid. Finally, a case study of rifampicin monoresistance demonstrates how this compendium could be used to advance our genetic understanding of rare resistance phenotypes. The data compendium is fully open source and it is hoped that it will facilitate and inspire future research for years to come"
352,"Development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in human sera and plasma. Here, we describe a serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the screening and identification of human SARS-CoV-2 seroconverters. This assay does not require the handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types in serum and plasma and is amenable to scaling. Serological assays are of critical importance to help define previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in populations, identify highly reactive human donors for convalescent plasma therapy and investigate correlates of protection."
353,"Studying the plasma proteome as the intermediate layer between the genome and the phenome has the potential to identify new disease processes. Here, we conducted a cis-focused proteogenomic analysis of 2,923 plasma proteins measured in 1,180 individuals using antibody-based assays. We (1) identify 256 unreported protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL); (2) demonstrate shared genetic regulation of 224 cis-pQTLs with 575 specific health outcomes, revealing examples for notable metabolic diseases (such as gastrin-releasing peptide as a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes); (3) improve causal gene assignment at 40% (n = 192) of overlapping risk loci; and (4) observe convergence of phenotypic consequences of cis-pQTLs and rare loss-of-function gene burden for 12 proteins, such as TIMD4 for lipoprotein metabolism. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating complementary proteomic technologies with genomics even at moderate scale to identify new mediators of metabolic diseases with the potential for therapeutic interventions. Koprulu et al. integrate antibody-based proteomic data with genomics to link protein-encoding genes to human metabolic disease."
354,"The phenotypic effect of some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) depends on their parental origin. We present a novel approach to detect parent-of-origin effects (POEs) in genome-wide genotype data of unrelated individuals. The method exploits increased phenotypic variance in the heterozygous genotype group relative to the homozygous groups. We applied the method to >56,000 unrelated individuals to search for POEs influencing body mass index (BMI). Six lead SNPs were carried forward for replication in five family-based studies (of similar to 4,000 trios). Two SNPs replicated: the paternal rs2471083-C allele (located near the imprinted KCNK9 gene) and the paternal rs3091869-T allele (located near the SLC2A10 gene) increased BMI equally (beta = 0.11 (SD), P < 0.0027) compared to the respective maternal alleles. Real-time PCR experiments of lymphoblastoid cell lines from the CEPH families showed that expression of both genes was dependent on parental origin of the SNPs alleles (P < 0.01). Our scheme opens new opportunities to exploit GWAS data of unrelated individuals to identify POEs and demonstrates that they play an important role in adult obesity."
355,"Brain imaging studies have shown that slow and progressive cerebral atrophy characterized the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite a large number of studies dedicated to AD, key questions about the lifespan evolution of AD biomarkers remain open. When does the AD model diverge from the normal aging model? What is the lifespan trajectory of imaging biomarkers for AD? How do the trajectories of biomarkers in AD differ from normal aging? To answer these questions, we proposed an innovative way by inferring brain structure model across the entire lifespan using a massive number of MRI (N = 4329). We compared the normal model based on 2944 control subjects with the pathological model based on 3262 patients (AD + Mild cognitive Impaired subjects) older than 55 years and controls younger than 55 years. Our study provides evidences of early divergence of the AD models from the normal aging trajectory before 40 years for the hippocampus, followed by the lateral ventricles and the amygdala around 40 years. Moreover, our lifespan model reveals the evolution of these biomarkers and suggests close abnormality evolution for the hippocampus and the amygdala, whereas trajectory of ventricular enlargement appears to follow an inverted U-shape. Finally, our models indicate that medial temporal lobe atrophy and ventricular enlargement are two mid-life physiopathological events characterizing AD brain."
356,"Background While the vaccines against COVID-19 are highly effective, COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough is possible despite being fully vaccinated. With SARS-CoV-2 variants still circulating, describing the characteristics of individuals who have experienced COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs could be hugely important in helping to determine who may be at greatest risk. Methods With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using routine clinical data from the OpenSAFELY-TPP database of fully vaccinated individuals, linked to secondary care and death registry data and described the characteristics of those experiencing COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs. Results As of 1st November 2021, a total of 15,501,550 individuals were identified as being fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with a median follow-up time of 149 days (IQR: 107-179). From within this population, a total of 579,780 (<4%) individuals reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. For every 1000 years of patient follow-up time, the corresponding incidence rate (IR) was 98.06 (95% CI 97.93-98.19). There were 28,580 COVID-19-related hospital admissions, 1980 COVID-19-related critical care admissions and 6435 COVID-19-related deaths; corresponding IRs 4.77 (95% CI 4.74-4.80), 0.33 (95% CI 0.32-0.34) and 1.07 (95% CI 1.06-1.09), respectively. The highest rates of breakthrough COVID-19 were seen in those in care homes and in patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis, transplant, haematological malignancy or who were immunocompromised. Conclusions While the majority of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases in England were mild, some differences in rates of breakthrough cases have been identified in several clinical groups. While it is important to note that these findings are simply descriptive and cannot be used to answer why certain groups have higher rates of COVID-19 breakthrough than others, the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 coupled with the number of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests still occurring is concerning and as numbers of fully vaccinated (and boosted) individuals increases and as follow-up time lengthens, so too will the number of COVID-19 breakthrough cases. Additional analyses, to assess vaccine waning and rates of breakthrough COVID-19 between different variants, aimed at identifying individuals at higher risk, are needed."
357,"Background Thromboembolism has been reported as a consequence of severe COVID-19. Although warfarin is a commonly used anticoagulant, it acts by antagonising vitamin K, which is low in patients with severe COVID-19. To date, the clinical evidence on the impact of regular use of warfarin on COVID-19-related thromboembolism is lacking. Methods On behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study investigating the association between warfarin and COVID-19 outcomes compared with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). We used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse primary care data and pseudonymously linked SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing data, hospital admissions and death records from England. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19-related outcomes comparing warfarin with DOACs in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. We also conducted negative control outcome analyses (being tested for SARS-CoV-2 and non-COVID-19 death) to assess the potential impact of confounding. Results A total of 92,339 warfarin users and 280,407 DOAC users were included. We observed a lower risk of all outcomes associated with warfarin versus DOACs [testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.68-0.79); COVID-19-related hospital admission, HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.68-0.83); COVID-19-related deaths, HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.66-0.83)]. A lower risk of negative control outcomes associated with warfarin versus DOACs was also observed [being tested for SARS-CoV-2, HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.79-0.81); non-COVID-19 deaths, HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.76-0.83)]. Conclusions Overall, this study shows no evidence of harmful effects of warfarin on severe COVID-19 disease."
358,"Background Hydroxychloroquine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has received much negative publicity for adverse events associated with its authorisation for emergency use to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods In this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I-2 value was less than 0.4. Findings The study included 956 374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310 350 users of sulfasalazine, 323 122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351 956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Selfcontrolled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.12-2.44]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 2.19 [95% CI 1.22-3.95]), chest pain or angina (1.15 [1.05-1.26]), and heart failure (1.22 [1.02-1.45]). Interpretation Hydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term. We call for careful consideration of the benefit-risk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment. Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd."
359,"Background: Predict Breast (www.predict.nhs.uk) is an online prognostication and treatment benefit tool for early invasive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to incorporate the prognostic effect of progesterone receptor (PR) status into a new version of PREDICT and to compare its performance to the current version (2.2). Method: The prognostic effect of PR status was based on the analysis of data from 45,088 European patients with breast cancer from 49 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratio for PR status. Data from a New Zealand study of 11,365 patients with early invasive breast cancer were used for external validation. Model calibration and discrimination were used to test the model performance. Results: Having a PR-positive tumour was associated with a 23% and 28% lower risk of dying from breast cancer for women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative and ER-positive breast cancer, respectively. The area under the ROC curve increased with the addition of PR status from 0.807 to 0.809 for patients with ER-negative tumours (p = 0.023) and from 0.898 to 0. 902 for patients with ER-positive tumours (p = 2.3 x 10(-6)) in the New Zealand cohort. Model calibration was modest with 940 observed deaths compared to 1151 predicted. Conclusion: The inclusion of the prognostic effect of PR status to PREDICT Breast has led to an improvement of model performance and more accurate absolute treatment benefit predic-tions for individual patients. Further studies should determine whether the baseline hazard function requires recalibration. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

360,"Objectives: To investigate whether associations of smoking with depression and anxiety are likely to be causal, using a Mendelian randomisation approach. Design: Mendelian randomisation meta-analyses using a genetic variant (rs16969968/rs1051730) as a proxy for smoking heaviness, and observational meta-analyses of the associations of smoking status and smoking heaviness with depression, anxiety and psychological distress. Participants: Current, former and never smokers of European ancestry aged >= 16 years from 25 studies in the Consortium for Causal Analysis Research in Tobacco and Alcohol (CARTA). Primary outcome measures: Binary definitions of depression, anxiety and psychological distress assessed by clinical interview, symptom scales or self-reported recall of clinician diagnosis. Results: The analytic sample included up to 58 176 never smokers, 37 428 former smokers and 32 028 current smokers (total N=127 632). In observational analyses, current smokers had 1.85 times greater odds of depression (95% CI 1.65 to 2.07), 1.71 times greater odds of anxiety (95% CI 1.54 to 1.90) and 1.69 times greater odds of psychological distress (95% CI 1.56 to 1.83) than never smokers. Former smokers also had greater odds of depression, anxiety and psychological distress than never smokers. There was evidence for positive associations of smoking heaviness with depression, anxiety and psychological distress (ORs per cigarette per day: 1.03 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.04), 1.03 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.04) and 1.02 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.03) respectively). In Mendelian randomisation analyses, there was no strong evidence that the minor allele of rs16969968/rs1051730 was associated with depression (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.05), anxiety (OR= 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.07) or psychological distress (OR= 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.06) in current smokers. Results were similar for former smokers. Conclusions: Findings from Mendelian randomisation analyses do not support a causal role of smoking heaviness in the development of depression and anxiety."
361,"Background Surgery is the main modality of cure for solid cancers and was prioritised to continue during COVID-19 outbreaks. This study aimed to identify immediate areas for system strengthening by comparing the delivery of elective cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in periods of lockdown versus light restrictions. Methods This international, prospective, cohort study enrolled 20 006 adult (>= 18 years) patients from 466 hospitals in 61 countries with 15 cancer types, who had a decision for curative surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic and were followed up until the point of surgery or cessation of follow-up (Aug 31, 2020). Average national Oxford COVID-19 Stringency Index scores were calculated to define the government response to COVID-19 for each patient for the period they awaited surgery, and classified into light restrictions (index <20), moderate lockdowns (20-60), and full lockdowns (>60). The primary outcome was the non-operation rate (defined as the proportion of patients who did not undergo planned surgery). Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to explore the associations between lockdowns and non-operation. Intervals from diagnosis to surgery were compared across COVID-19 government response index groups. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04384926. Findings Of eligible patients awaiting surgery, 2003 (10middot0%) of 20 006 did not receive surgery after a median follow-up of 23 weeks (IQR 16-30), all of whom had a COVID-19-related reason given for non-operation. Light restrictions were associated with a 0middot6% non-operation rate (26 of 4521), moderate lockdowns with a 5middot5% rate (201 of 3646; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0middot81, 95% CI 0middot77-0middot84; p<0middot0001), and full lockdowns with a 15middot0% rate (1775 of 11 827; HR 0middot51, 0middot50-0middot53; p<0middot0001). In sensitivity analyses, including adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 case notification rates, moderate lockdowns (HR 0middot84, 95% CI 0middot80-0middot88; p<0middot001), and full lockdowns (0middot57, 0middot54-0middot60; p<0middot001), remained independently associated with non-operation. Surgery beyond 12 weeks from diagnosis in patients without neoadjuvant therapy increased during lockdowns (374 [9middot1%] of 4521 in light restrictions, 317 [10middot4%] of 3646 in moderate lockdowns, 2001 [23middot8%] of 11 827 in full lockdowns), although there were no differences in resectability rates observed with longer delays. Interpretation Cancer surgery systems worldwide were fragile to lockdowns, with one in seven patients who were in regions with full lockdowns not undergoing planned surgery and experiencing longer preoperative delays. Although short-term oncological outcomes were not compromised in those selected for surgery, delays and non-operations might lead to long-term reductions in survival. During current and future periods of societal restriction, the resilience of elective surgery systems requires strengthening, which might include protected elective surgical pathways and longterm investment in surge capacity for acute care during public health emergencies to protect elective staff and services.

362,"The aim of this study was to obtain a longitudinal evaluation of the exposure to chlorpyrifos (CP) and chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPM) in agricultural workers in South Tyrol and in a residential group living in the same area. CP and CPM are widely used pesticides in agriculture. Biological monitoring of CP and CPM exposure in humans can be achieved by analyzing urinary levels of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy). TCPy a metabolite of CP and CPM which is produced by a two-step metabolic transformation. Between May 14th, 2014 and March 16th, 2015 we conducted a longitudinal study on 28 farmers actively working in spray pesticide treatment and 43 non-farmers living in the same agricultural area of South Tyrol (Italy). Urine samples were collected at two time points: during the pesticide treatment period and in a temporally distant season that should guarantee metabolite clearance. We developed and validated a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination of urinary TCPy levels. During the treatment season, both farmers and residents showed higher TCPy levels (median = 6.8 and 6.73 ug/g creatinine, respectively) than during the non-treatment season (median = 2.54 and 3.22 ug/g creatinine, respectively), suggesting a similar effect of the pesticide spraying on both groups. However, the observed TCPy levels resulted in a daily CP and CPM intake well below the limits recommended by FAO/WHO. During the non-treatment season, non-farmers showed higher TCPy levels values than farmers, suggesting the existence of TCPy of other unmeasured sources of exposure not considered in this study. This suggests that, for a comprehensive evaluation of the risks associated with TCPy exposure, additional sources should be identified in addition to CP and CPM pesticides."
363,"Objectives: To investigate, using a Mendelian randomisation approach, whether heavier smoking is associated with a range of regional adiposity phenotypes, in particular those related to abdominal adiposity. Design: Mendelian randomisation meta-analyses using a genetic variant (rs16969968/rs1051730 in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene region) as a proxy for smoking heaviness, of the associations of smoking heaviness with a range of adiposity phenotypes. Participants: 148 731 current, former and neversmokers of European ancestry aged >= 16 years from 29 studies in the consortium for Causal Analysis Research in Tobacco and Alcohol (CARTA). Primary outcome measures: Waist and hip circumferences, and waist-hip ratio. Results: The data included up to 66 809 never-smokers, 43 009 former smokers and 38 913 current daily cigarette smokers. Among current smokers, for each extra minor allele, the geometric mean was lower for waist circumference by -0.40% (95% Cl -0.57% to - 0.22%), with effects on hip circumference, waist-hip ratio and body mass index (BMI) being -0.31% (95% Cl - 0.42% to -0.19), -0.08% (-0.19% to 0.03%) and - 0.74% (-0.96% to -0.51%), respectively. In contrast, among never-smokers, these effects were higher by 0.23% (0.09% to 0.36%), 0.17% (0.08% to 0.26%), 0.07% (-0.01% to 0.15%) and 0.35% (0.18% to 0.52%), respectively. When adjusting the three central adiposity measures for BMI, the effects among current smokers changed direction and were higher by 0.14% (0.05% to 0.22%) for waist circumference, 0.02% (-0.05% to 0.08%) for hip circumference and 0.10% (0.02% to 0.19%) for waist-hip ratio, for each extra minor allele. Conclusions: For a given BMI, a gene variant associated with increased cigarette consumption was associated with increased waist circumference. Smoking in an effort to control weight may lead to accumulation of central adiposity."
364,"Objectives The therapeutic use of nutrient-based 'nutraceuticals' and plant-based 'phytoceuticals' for the treatment of mental disorders is common; however, despite recent research progress, there have not been any updated global clinical guidelines since 2015. To address this, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders (CANMAT) convened an international taskforce involving 31 leading academics and clinicians from 15 countries, between 2019 and 2021. These guidelines are aimed at providing a definitive evidence-informed approach to assist clinicians in making decisions around the use of such agents for major psychiatric disorders. We also provide detail on safety and tolerability, and clinical advice regarding prescription (e.g. indications, dosage), in addition to consideration for use in specialised populations. Methods The methodology was based on the WFSBP guidelines development process. Evidence was assessed based on the WFSBP grading of evidence (and was modified to focus on Grade A level evidence - meta-analysis or two or more RCTs - due to the breadth of data available across all nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals across major psychiatric disorders). The taskforce assessed both the 'level of evidence' (LoE) (i.e. meta-analyses or RCTs) and the assessment of the direction of the evidence, to determine whether the intervention was 'Recommended' (+++), 'Provisionally Recommended' (++), 'Weakly Recommended' (+), 'Not Currently Recommended' (+/-), or 'Not Recommended' (-) for a particular condition. Due to the number of clinical trials now available in the field, we firstly examined the data from our two meta-reviews of meta-analyses (nutraceuticals conducted in 2019, and phytoceuticals in 2020). We then performed a search of additional relevant RCTs and reported on both these data as the primary drivers supporting our clinical recommendations. Lower levels of evidence, including isolated RCTs, open label studies, case studies, preclinical research, and interventions with only traditional or anecdotal use, were not assessed. Results Amongst nutraceuticals with Grade A evidence, positive directionality and varying levels of support (recommended, provisionally recommended, or weakly recommended) was found for adjunctive omega-3 fatty acids (+++), vitamin D (+), adjunctive probiotics (++), adjunctive zinc (++), methylfolate (+), and adjunctive s-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) (+) in the treatment of unipolar depression. Monotherapy omega-3 (+/-), folic acid (-), vitamin C (-), tryptophan (+/-), creatine (+/-), inositol (-), magnesium (-), and n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (+/-) and SAMe (+/-) were not supported for this use. In bipolar disorder, omega-3 had weak support for bipolar depression (+), while NAC was not currently recommended (+/-). NAC was weakly recommended (+) in the treatment of OCD-related disorders; however, no other nutraceutical had sufficient evidence in any anxiety-related disorder. Vitamin D (+), NAC (++), methylfolate (++) were recommended to varying degrees in the treatment of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia, while omega-3 fatty acids were not, although evidence suggests a role for prevention of transition to psychosis in high-risk youth, with potential pre-existing fatty acid deficiency. Micronutrients (+) and vitamin D (+) were weakly supported in the treatment of ADHD, while omega-3 (+/-) and omega-9 fatty acids (-), acetyl L carnitine (-), and zinc (+/-) were not supported. Phytoceuticals with supporting Grade A evidence and positive directionality included St John's wort (+++), saffron (++), curcumin (++), and lavender (+) in the treatment of unipolar depression, while rhodiola use was not supported for use in mood disorders. Ashwagandha (++), galphimia (+), and lavender (++) were modestly supported in the treatment of anxiety disorders, while kava (-) and chamomile (+/-) were not recommended for generalised anxiety disorder. Ginkgo was weakly supported in the adjunctive treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia (+), but not supported in the treatment of ADHD (+/-). With respect to safety and tolerability, all interventions were deemed to have varying acceptable levels of safety and tolerability for low-risk over-the-counter use in most circumstances. Quality and standardisation of phytoceuticals was also raised by the taskforce as a key limiting issue for firmer confidence in these agents. Finally, the taskforce noted that such use of nutraceuticals or phytoceuticals be primarily recommended (where supportive evidence exists) adjunctively within a standard medical/health professional care model, especially in cases of more severe mental illness. Some meta-analyses reviewed contained data from heterogenous studies involving poor methodology. Isolated RCTs and other data such as open label or case series were not included, and it is recognised that an absence of data does not imply lack of efficacy. Conclusions Based on the current data and clinician input, a range of nutraceuticals and phytoceuticals were given either a supportive recommendation or a provisional recommendation across a range of various psychiatric disorders. However several had only a weak endorsement for potential use; for a few it was not possible to reach a clear recommendation direction, largely due to mixed study findings; while some other agents showed no obvious therapeutic benefit and were clearly not recommended for use. It is the intention of these guidelines to inform psychiatric/medical, and health professional practice globally."
365,"Background High-resolution estimates of HIV burden across space and time provide an important tool for tracking and monitoring the progress of prevention and control efforts and assist with improving the precision and efficiency of targeting efforts. We aimed to assess HIV incidence and HIV mortality for all second-level administrative units across sub-Saharan Africa. Methods In this modelling study, we developed a framework that used the geographically specific HIV prevalence data collected in seroprevalence surveys and antenatal care clinics to train a model that estimates HIV incidence and mortality among individuals aged 15-49 years. We used a model-based geostatistical framework to estimate HIV prevalence at the second administrative level in 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2000-18 and sought data on the number of individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) by second-level administrative unit. We then modified the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) to use these HIV prevalence and treatment estimates to estimate HIV incidence and mortality by second-level administrative unit. Findings The estimates suggest substantial variation in HIV incidence and mortality rates both between and within countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 15 countries having a ten-times or greater difference in estimated HIV incidence between the second- level administrative units with the lowest and highest estimated incidence levels. Across all 44 countries in 2018, HIV incidence ranged from 2.8 (95% uncertainty interval 2.1-3.8) in Mauritania to 1585.9 (1369.4-1824.8) cases per 100 000 people in Lesotho and HIV mortality ranged from 0.8 (0.7-0.9) in Mauritania to 676.5 (513.6-888.0) deaths per 100 000 people in Lesotho. Variation in both incidence and mortality was substantially greater at the subnational level than at the national level and the highest estimated rates were accordingly higher. Among second-level administrative units, Guija District, Gaza Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV incidence (4661.7 [2544.8-8120.3]) cases per 100 000 people in 2018 and Inhassunge District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique, had the highest estimated HIV mortality rate (1163.0 [679.0-1866.8]) deaths per 100 000 people. Further, the rate of reduction in HIV incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2018, as well as the ratio of new infections to the number of people living with HIV was highly variable. Although most second-level administrative units had declines in the number of new cases (3316 [81.1%] of 4087 units) and number of deaths (3325 [81.4%]), nearly all appeared well short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths between 2010 and 2020. Interpretation Our estimates suggest that most second-level administrative units in sub-Saharan Africa are falling short of the targeted 75% reduction in new cases and deaths by 2020, which is further compounded by substantial within-country variability. These estimates will help decision makers and programme implementers expand access to ART and better target health resources to higher burden subnational areas. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

366,"Background-Genome-wide association studies have recently identified >400 loci that harbor DNA sequence variants that influence blood pressure (BP). Our earlier studies identified and validated 56 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with BP from meta-analyses of exome chip genotype data. An additional 100 variants yielded suggestive evidence of association. Methods and Results-Here, we augment the sample with 140886 European individuals from the UK Biobank, in whom 77 of the 100 suggestive SNVs were available for association analysis with systolic BP or diastolic BP or pulse pressure. We performed 2 meta-analyses, one in individuals of European, South Asian, African, and Hispanic descent (pan-ancestry, approximate to 475000), and the other in the subset of individuals of European descent (approximate to 423000). Twenty-one SNVs were genome-wide significant (P<5x10(-8) ) for BP, of which 4 are new BP loci: rs9678851 (missense, SLC4A1AP), rs7437940 (AFAP1), rs13303 (missense, STAB1), and rs1055144 (7p15.2). In addition, we identified a potentially independent novel BP-associated SNV, rs3416322 (missense, SYNPO2L) at a known locus, uncorrelated with the previously reported SNVs. Two SNVs are associated with expression levels of nearby genes, and SNVs at 3 loci are associated with other traits. One SNV with a minor allele frequency <0.01, (rs3025380 at DBH) was genome-wide significant. Conclusions-We report 4 novel loci associated with BP regulation, and 1 independent variant at an established BP locus. This analysis highlights several candidate genes with variation that alter protein function or gene expression for potential follow-up."
367,"SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a major threat to the lungs and multiple other organs, occasionally causing death. Until effective vaccines are developed to curb the pandemic, it is paramount to define the mechanisms and develop protective therapies to prevent organ dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Individuals that develop severe manifestations have signs of dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses. Emerging evidence implicates neutrophils and the disbalance between neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and degradation plays a central role in the pathophysiology of inflammation, coagulopathy, organ damage, and immunothrombosis that characterize severe cases of COVID-19. Here, we discuss the evidence supporting a role for NETs in COVID-19 manifestations and present putative mechanisms, by which NETs promote tissue injury and immunothrombosis. We present therapeutic strategies, which have been successful in the treatment of immun omicron-inflammatory disorders and which target dysregulated NET formation or degradation, as potential approaches that may benefit patients with severe COVID-19."
368,"Compared with the general population, an excess of rare copy number variants (CNVs) has been identified in people with schizophrenia. Females with neurodevelopmental disorders and in the general population have been reported to carry more large, rare CNVs than males. Given that many schizophrenia datasets do not have equal gender ratios in cases and controls, sex differences in CNV burden might have impacted on estimates of case-related CNV burden and also on associations to individual loci. In a sample of 13,276 cases and 17,863 controls, we observed a small but significant excess of large (>= 500 Kb), rare (<1%) CNVs in females compared with males in both cases and controls (OR = 1.17, P = 0.0012 for controls; OR = 1.11, P = 0.045 for cases). The burden of 11 schizophrenia-associated CNVs was significantly higher in female cases compared with male cases (OR = 1.38, P = 0.0055), but after accounting for the rates of CNVs in controls, we found no significant gender difference in the risk conferred by these loci. Controlling for gender had a negligible effect on the significance of association between specific CNVs and schizophrenia. The female excess of large CNVs in both cases and controls suggests a female protective mechanism exists for deleterious CNVs that may extend beyond neurodevelopmental phenotypes."
369,"We recently built normative data for FreeSurfer morphometric estimates of cortical regions using its default atlas parcellation (Desikan-Killiany or DK) according to individual and scanner characteristics. We aimed to produced similar normative values for Desikan-Killianny-Tourville (DKT) and ex vivo-based labeling protocols, as well as examine the differences between these three atlases. Surfaces, thicknesses, and volumes of cortical regions were produced using cross-sectional magnetic resonance scans from the same 2713 healthy individuals aged 18-94 years as used in the reported DK norms. Models predicting regional cortical estimates of each hemisphere were produced using age, sex, estimated intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner manufacturer and magnetic field strength (MFS) as predictors. The DKT and DK models generally included the same predictors and produced similar R-2. Comparison between DK, DKT, ex vivo atlases normative cortical measures showed that the three protocols generally produced similar normative values."
370,"Importance Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) allows the direct assessment of amyloid deposition, one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. However, this technique is currently not widely reimbursed because of the lack of appropriately designed studies demonstrating its clinical effect.Objective To assess the clinical effect of amyloid PET in memory clinic patients.Design, Setting, and Participants The AMYPAD-DPMS is a prospective randomized clinical trial in 8 European memory clinics. Participants were allocated (using a minimization method) to 3 study groups based on the performance of amyloid PET: arm 1, early in the diagnostic workup (within 1 month); arm 2, late in the diagnostic workup (after a mean [SD] 8 [2] months); or arm 3, if and when the managing physician chose. Participants were patients with subjective cognitive decline plus (SCD+; SCD plus clinical features increasing the likelihood of preclinical Alzheimer disease), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia; they were assessed at baseline and after 3 months. Recruitment took place between April 16, 2018, and October 30, 2020. Data analysis was performed from July 2022 to January 2023.Intervention Amyloid PET.Main Outcome and Measure The main outcome was the difference between arm 1 and arm 2 in the proportion of participants receiving an etiological diagnosis with a very high confidence (ie, >= 90% on a 50%-100% visual numeric scale) after 3 months.Results A total of 844 participants were screened, and 840 were enrolled (291 in arm 1, 271 in arm 2, 278 in arm 3). Baseline and 3-month visit data were available for 272 participants in arm 1 and 260 in arm 2 (median [IQR] age: 71 [65-77] and 71 [65-77] years; 150/272 male [55%] and 135/260 male [52%]; 122/272 female [45%] and 125/260 female [48%]; median [IQR] education: 12 [10-15] and 13 [10-16] years, respectively). After 3 months, 109 of 272 participants (40%) in arm 1 had a diagnosis with very high confidence vs 30 of 260 (11%) in arm 2 (P < .001). This was consistent across cognitive stages (SCD+: 25/84 [30%] vs 5/78 [6%]; P < .001; MCI: 45/108 [42%] vs 9/102 [9%]; P < .001; dementia: 39/80 [49%] vs 16/80 [20%]; P < .001).Conclusion and Relevance In this study, early amyloid PET allowed memory clinic patients to receive an etiological diagnosis with very high confidence after only 3 months compared with patients who had not undergone amyloid PET. These findings support the implementation of amyloid PET early in the diagnostic workup of memory clinic patients."
371,"Proper normative data of anatomical measurements of cortical regions, allowing to quantify brain abnormalities, are lacking. We developed norms for regional cortical surface areas, thicknesses, and volumes based on cross-sectional MRI scans from 2713 healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years using 23 samples provided by 21 independent research groups. The segmentation was conducted using FreeSurfer, a widely used and freely available automated segmentation software. Models predicting regional cortical estimates of each hemisphere were produced using age, sex, estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength, and interactions as predictors. The explained variance for the left/right cortex was 76%/76% for surface area, 43%/42% for thickness, and 80%/80% for volume. The mean explained variance for all regions was 41% for surface areas, 27% for thicknesses, and 46% for volumes. Age, sex and eTIV predicted most of the explained variance for surface areas and volumes while age was the main predictors for thicknesses. Scanner characteristics generally predicted a limited amount of variance, but this effect was stronger for thicknesses than surface areas and volumes. For new individuals, estimates of their expected surface area, thickness and volume based on their characteristics and the scanner characteristics can be obtained using the derived formulas, as well as Z score effect sizes denoting the extent of the deviation from the normative sample. Models predicting normative values were validated in independent samples of healthy adults, showing satisfactory validation R-2. Deviations from the normative sample were measured in individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia and expected patterns of deviations were observed."
372,"Normative data for volumetric estimates of brain structures are necessary to adequately assess brain volume alterations in individuals with suspected neurological or psychiatric conditions. Although many studies have described age and sex effects in healthy individuals for brain morphometry assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, proper normative values allowing to quantify potential brain abnormalities are needed. We developed norms for volumetric estimates of subcortical brain regions based on cross-sectional magnetic resonance scans from 2790 healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years using 23 samples provided by 21 independent research groups. The segmentation was conducted using FreeSurfer, a widely used and freely available automated segmentation software. Models predicting subcortical regional volumes of each hemisphere were produced including age, sex, estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength, and interactions as predictors. The mean explained variance by the models was 48%. For most regions, age, sex and eTIV predicted most of the explained variance while manufacturer, magnetic field strength and interactions predicted a limited amount. Estimates of the expected volumes of an individual based on its characteristics and the scanner characteristics can be obtained using derived formulas. For a new individual, significance test for volume abnormality, effect size and estimated percentage of the normative population with a smaller volume can be obtained. Normative values were validated in independent samples of healthy adults and in adults with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
373,"Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) appear as small, circular, well defined hypointense lesions of a few mm in size on T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (T2*-GRE) images and appear enhanced on susceptibility weighted images (SWI). Due to their small size, contrast variations and other mimics (e.g., blood vessels), CMBs are highly challenging to detect automatically. In large datasets (e.g., the UK Biobank dataset), exhaustively labelling CMBs manually is difficult and time consuming. Hence it would be useful to preselect candidate CMB subjects in order to focus on those for manual labelling, which is essential for training and testing automated CMB detection tools on these datasets. In this work, we aim to detect CMB candidate subjects from a larger dataset, UK Biobank, using a machine learning-based, computationally light pipeline. For our evaluation, we used 3 different datasets, with different intensity characteristics, acquired with different scanners. They include the UK Biobank dataset and two clinical datasets with different pathological conditions. We developed and evaluated our pipelines on different types of images, consisting of SWI or GRE images. We also used the UK Biobank dataset to compare our approach with alternative CMB preselection methods using non-imaging factors and/or imaging data. Finally, we evaluated the pipeline's generalisability across datasets. Our method provided subject-level detection accuracy > 80% on all the datasets (within-dataset results), and showed good generalisability across datasets, providing a consistent accuracy of over 80%, even when evaluated across different modalities."
374,"Oligogenic inheritance implies a role for several genetic factors in disease etiology. We studied oligogenic inheritance in Parkinson's (PD) by assessing the potential burden of additional rare variants in established Mendelian genes and/or GBA, in individuals with and without a primary pathogenic genetic cause in two large independent cohorts totaling 7,900 PD cases and 6,166 controls. An excess (>= 30%) of cases with a recognised primary genetic cause had >= 1 additional rare variants in Mendelian PD genes, as compared with no known mutation PD cases (17%) and unaffected controls (16%), supporting our hypothesis. Carriers of additional Mendelian gene variants have younger ages at onset (AAO). The effect of additional Mendelian variants in LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers, of which ATP13A2 variation is particularly common, may account for some of the variation in penetrance. About 10% of No Known Mutation-PD cases harbour a rare GBA variant compared to known pathogenic mutation PD cases (8%) and controls (5%), with carriers having earlier AAOs. Together, the data suggest that the oligogenic inheritance of rare Mendelian variants may be important in patient with a primary pathogenic cause, whereas GBA increases risk across all forms of PD. This study highlights the potential genetic complexity of Mendelian PD. The identification of potential modifying variants provides new insights into disease mechanisms by potentially separating relevant from benign variants and by the interaction between genes in specific pathways. In the future this may be relevant to genetic testing and counselling of patients with PD and their families."
375,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a threat to global public health. To mitigate the impacts of AMR, it is important to identify the molecular mechanisms of AMR and thereby determine optimal therapy as early as possible. Conventional machine learning-based drug-resistance analyses assume genetic variations to be homogeneous, thus not distinguishing between coding and intergenic sequences. In this study, we represent genetic data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a graph, and then adopt a deep graph learning method-heterogeneous graph attention network ('HGAT-AMR')-to predict anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance. The HGAT-AMR model is able to accommodate incomplete phenotypic profiles, as well as provide 'attention scores' of genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) both at a population level and for individual samples. These scores encode the inputs, which the model is 'paying attention to' in making its drug resistance predictions. The results show that the proposed model generated the best area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for isoniazid and rifampicin (98.53 and 99.10%), the best sensitivity for three first-line drugs (94.91% for isoniazid, 96.60% for ethambutol and 90.63% for pyrazinamide), and maintained performance when the data were associated with incomplete phenotypes (i.e. for those isolates for which phenotypic data for some drugs were missing). We also demonstrate that the model successfully identifies genes and SNPs associated with drug resistance, mitigating the impact of resistance profile while considering particular drug resistance, which is consistent with domain knowledge."
376,"Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci influencing cross-sectional lung function, but less is known about genes influencing longitudinal change in lung function. Methods: We performed GWAS of the rate of change in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) in 14 longitudinal, population-based cohort studies comprising 27,249 adults of European ancestry using linear mixed effects model and combined cohort-specific results using fixed effect meta-analysis to identify novel genetic loci associated with longitudinal change in lung function. Gene expression analyses were subsequently performed for identified genetic loci. As a secondary aim, we estimated the mean rate of decline in FEV1 by smoking pattern, irrespective of genotypes, across these 14 studies using meta-analysis. Results: The overall meta-analysis produced suggestive evidence for association at the novel IL16/STARD5/TMC3 locus on chromosome 15 (P = 5.71 x 10(-7)). In addition, meta-analysis using the five cohorts with >= 3 FEV1 measurements per participant identified the novel ME3 locus on chromosome 11 (P = 2.18 x 10(-8)) at genome-wide significance. Neither locus was associated with FEV1 decline in two additional cohort studies. We confirmed gene expression of IL16, STARD5, and ME3 in multiple lung tissues. Publicly available microarray data confirmed differential expression of all three genes in lung samples from COPD patients compared with controls. Irrespective of genotypes, the combined estimate for FEV1 decline was 26.9, 29.2 and 35.7 mL/year in never, former, and persistent smokers, respectively. Conclusions: In this large-scale GWAS, we identified two novel genetic loci in association with the rate of change in FEV1 that harbor candidate genes with biologically plausible functional links to lung function."
377,"BACKGROUND Approximately 7% of American adults have severe hypercholesterolemia (untreated low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol >= 190 mg/dl), which may be due to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Lifelong LDL cholesterol elevations in FH mutation carriers may confer coronary artery disease (CAD) risk beyond that captured by a single LDL cholesterol measurement. OBJECTIVES This study assessed the prevalence of an FH mutation among those with severe hypercholesterolemia and determined whether CAD risk varies according to mutation status beyond the observed LDL cholesterol level. METHODS Three genes causative for FH (LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9) were sequenced in 26,025 participants from 7 case-control studies (5,540 CAD case subjects, 8,577 CAD-free control subjects) and 5 prospective cohort studies (11,908 participants). FH mutations included loss-of-function variants in LDLR, missense mutations in LDLR predicted to be damaging, and variants linked to FH in ClinVar, a clinical genetics database. RESULTS Among 20,485 CAD-free control and prospective cohort participants, 1,386 (6.7%) had LDL cholesterol >= 190 mg/dl; of these, only 24 (1.7%) carried an FH mutation. Within any stratum of observed LDL cholesterol, risk of CAD was higher among FH mutation carriers than noncarriers. Compared with a reference group with LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dl and no mutation, participants with LDL cholesterol >= 190 mg/dl and no FH mutation had a 6-fold higher risk for CAD (odds ratio: 6.0; 95% confidence interval: 5.2 to 6.9), whereas those with both LDL cholesterol >= 190 mg/dl and an FH mutation demonstrated a 22-fold increased risk (odds ratio: 22.3; 95% confidence interval: 10.7 to 53.2). In an analysis of participants with serial lipid measurements over many years, FH mutation carriers had higher cumulative exposure to LDL cholesterol than noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS Among participants with LDL cholesterol >= 190 mg/dl, gene sequencing identified an FH mutation in <2%. However, for any observed LDL cholesterol, FH mutation carriers had substantially increased risk for CAD. (C) 2016 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation."
378,"It is unclear whether genetic markers interact with risk factors to influence atrial fibrillation (AF) risk. We performed genome-wide interaction analyses between genetic variants and age, sex, hypertension, and body mass index in the AFGen Consortium. Study-specific results were combined using meta-analysis (88,383 individuals of European descent, including 7,292 with AF). Variants with nominal interaction associations in the discovery analysis were tested for association in four independent studies (131,441 individuals, including 5,722 with AF). In the discovery analysis, the AF risk associated with the minor rs6817105 allele (at the PITX2 locus) was greater among subjects <= 65 years of age than among those >65 years (interaction p-value = 4.0 x 10(-5)). The interaction p-value exceeded genome-wide significance in combined discovery and replication analyses (interaction p-value = 1.7 x 10(-8)). We observed one genome-wide significant interaction with body mass index and several suggestive interactions with age, sex, and body mass index in the discovery analysis. However, none was replicated in the independent sample. Our findings suggest that the pathogenesis of AF may differ according to age in individuals of European descent, but we did not observe evidence of statistically significant genetic interactions with sex, body mass index, or hypertension on AF risk."
379,"Background Smoking is an important cardiovascular disease risk factor, but the mechanisms linking smoking to blood pressure are poorly understood. Methods and Results Data on 141317 participants (62666 never, 40669 former, 37982 current smokers) from 23 population-based studies were included in observational and Mendelian randomization meta-analyses of the associations of smoking status and smoking heaviness with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, and resting heart rate. For the Mendelian randomization analyses, a genetic variant rs16969968/rs1051730 was used as a proxy for smoking heaviness in current smokers. In observational analyses, current as compared with never smoking was associated with lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure and lower hypertension risk, but with higher resting heart rate. In observational analyses among current smokers, 1 cigarette/day higher level of smoking heaviness was associated with higher (0.21 bpm; 95% confidence interval 0.19; 0.24) resting heart rate and slightly higher diastolic blood pressure (0.05 mmHg; 95% confidence interval 0.02; 0.08) and systolic blood pressure (0.08 mmHg; 95% confidence interval 0.03; 0.13). However, in Mendelian randomization analyses among current smokers, although each smoking increasing allele of rs16969968/rs1051730 was associated with higher resting heart rate (0.36 bpm/allele; 95% confidence interval 0.18; 0.54), there was no strong association with diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, or hypertension. This would suggest a 7 bpm higher heart rate in those who smoke 20 cigarettes/day. Conclusions This Mendelian randomization meta-analysis supports a causal association of smoking heaviness with higher level of resting heart rate, but not with blood pressure. These findings suggest that part of the cardiovascular risk of smoking may operate through increasing resting heart rate."
380,"The role of genetic variability in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is now indisputable; however, data regarding copy number variation (CNV) in this disease has been lacking. Here, we used whole-genome genotyping of 1454 DLB cases and 1525 controls to assess copy number variability. We used 2 algorithms to confidently detect CNVs, performed a case-control association analysis, screened for candidate CNVs previously associated with DLB-related diseases, and performed a candidate gene approach to fully explore the data. We identified 5 CNV regions with a significant genome-wide association to DLB; 2 of these were only present in cases and absent from publicly available databases: one of the regions overlapped LAPTM4B, a known lysosomal protein, whereas the other overlapped the NME1 locus and SPAG9. We also identified DLB cases presenting rare CNVs in genes previously associated with DLB or related neurodegenerative diseases, such as SNCA, APP, and MAPT. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting genome-wide CNVs in a large DLB cohort. These results provide preliminary evidence for the contribution of CNVs in DLB risk. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

381,"Background Estimates of the heritability of plasma fibrinogen concentration, an established predictor of cardiovascular disease, range from 34% to 50%. Genetic variants so far identified by genome-wide association studies explain only a small proportion (<2%) of its variation. Methods and Results We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 genome-wide association studies including >90 000 subjects of European ancestry, the first genome-wide association meta-analysis of fibrinogen levels in 7 studies in blacks totaling 8289 samples, and a genome-wide association study in Hispanics totaling 1366 samples. Evaluation for association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with clinical outcomes included a total of 40 695 cases and 85 582 controls for coronary artery disease, 4752 cases and 24 030 controls for stroke, and 3208 cases and 46 167 controls for venous thromboembolism. Overall, we identified 24 genome-wide significant (P<5x10(-8)) independent signals in 23 loci, including 15 novel associations, together accounting for 3.7% of plasma fibrinogen variation. Gene-set enrichment analysis highlighted key roles in fibrinogen regulation for the 3 structural fibrinogen genes and pathways related to inflammation, adipocytokines, and thyrotrophin-releasing hormone signaling. Whereas lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a few loci were significantly associated with coronary artery disease, the combined effect of all 24 fibrinogen-associated lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms was not significant for coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism. Conclusions We identify 23 robustly associated fibrinogen loci, 15 of which are new. Clinical outcome analysis of these loci does not support a causal relationship between circulating levels of fibrinogen and coronary artery disease, stroke, or venous thromboembolism."
382,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with neuronal inclusions of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP) represents the most common pathological subtype of FTLD. We established the international FTLD-TDP whole-genome sequencing consortium to thoroughly characterize the known genetic causes of FTLD-TDP and identify novel genetic risk factors. Through the study of 1131 unrelated Caucasian patients, we estimated that C9orf72 repeat expansions and GRN loss-of-function mutations account for 25.5% and 13.9% of FTLD-TDP patients, respectively. Mutations in TBK1 (1.5%) and other known FTLD genes (1.4%) were rare, and the disease in 57.7% of FTLD-TDP patients was unexplained by the known FTLD genes. To unravel the contribution of common genetic factors to the FTLD-TDP etiology in these patients, we conducted a two-stage association study comprising the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 517 FTLD-TDP patients and 838 controls, followed by targeted genotyping of the most associated genomic loci in 119 additional FTLD-TDP patients and 1653 controls. We identified three genome-wide significant FTLD-TDP risk loci: one new locus at chromosome 7q36 within the DPP6 gene led by rs118113626 (p value = 4.82e - 08, OR = 2.12), and two known loci: UNC13A, led by rs1297319 (p value = 1.27e - 08, OR = 1.50) and HLA-DQA2 led by rs17219281 (p value = 3.22e - 08, OR = 1.98). While HLA represents a locus previously implicated in clinical FTLD and related neurodegenerative disorders, the association signal in our study is independent from previously reported associations. Through inspection of our whole-genome sequence data for genes with an excess of rare loss-of-function variants in FTLD-TDP patients (n >= 3) as compared to controls (n = 0), we further discovered a possible role for genes functioning within the TBK1-related immune pathway (e.g., DHX58, TRIM21, IRF7) in the genetic etiology of FTLD-TDP. Together, our study based on the largest cohort of unrelated FTLD-TDP patients assembled to date provides a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape of FTLD-TDP, nominates novel FTLD-TDP risk loci, and strongly implicates the immune pathway in FTLD-TDP pathogenesis."
383,"Resting heart rate is a heritable trait, and an increase in heart rate is associated with increased mortality risk. Genome-wide association study analyses have found loci associated with resting heart rate, at the time of our study these loci explained 0.9% of the variation. This study aims to discover new genetic loci associated with heart rate from Exome Chip meta-analyses. Heart rate was measured from either elecrtrocardiograms or pulse recordings. We meta-analysed heart rate association results from 104 452 European-ancestry individuals from 30 cohorts, genotyped using the Exome Chip. Twenty-four variants were selected for follow-up in an independent dataset (UK Biobank, N = 134 251). Conditional and gene-based testing was undertaken, and variants were investigated with bioinformatics methods. We discovered five novel heart rate loci, and one new independent low-frequency non-synonymous variant in an established heart rate locus (KIAA1755). Lead variants in four of the novel loci are non-synonymous variants in the genes C10orf71, DALDR3, TESK2 and SEC31B. The variant at SEC31B is significantly associated with SEC31B expression in heart and tibial nerve tissue. Further candidate genes were detected from long-range regulatory chromatin interactions in heart tissue (SCD, SLF2 and MAPK8). We observed significant enrichment in DNase I hypersensitive sites in fetal heart and lung. Moreover, enrichment was seen for the first time in human neuronal progenitor cells (derived from embryonic stem cells) and fetal muscle samples by including our novel variants. Our findings advance the knowledge of the genetic architecture of heart rate, and indicate new candidate genes for follow-up functional studies."
384,"Recent large-scale genetic studies have allowed for the first glimpse of the effects of common genetic variability in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), identifying risk variants with appreciable effect sizes. However, it is currently well established that a substantial portion of the genetic heritable component of complex traits is not captured by genome-wide significant SNPs. To overcome this issue, we have estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variability (SNP heritability) in DLB using a method that is unbiased by allele frequency or linkage disequilibrium properties of the underlying variants. This shows that the heritability of DLB is nearly twice as high as previous estimates based on common variants only (31% vs 59.9%). We also determine the amount of phenotypic variance in DLB that can be explained by recent polygenic risk scores from either Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), and show that, despite being highly significant, they explain a low amount of variance. Additionally, to identify pleiotropic events that might improve our understanding of the disease, we performed genetic correlation analyses of DLB with over 200 diseases and biomedically relevant traits. Our data shows that DLB has a positive correlation with education phenotypes, which is opposite to what occurs in AD. Overall, our data suggests that novel genetic risk factors for DLB should be identified by larger GWAS and these are likely to be independent from known AD and PD risk variants."
